The flavor is very nice. It has the hop flavors of a Bavarian brew with a hint of Bohemian flair perhaps, but mainly it is orange and citrusy with some grassiness.

This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with just a few teensy floaties, and one finger of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly just bubbly dirty white head, which leaves some minor low-lying raincloud lace around the glass as things quickly settle.<br>
<br>
It smells of semi-sweet lemon and lime juice, bready pale malt, a soft stoney flintiness, and an ethereal and rather indistinct bitterness.  The taste is fairly sweet lemon/lime, perhaps a bit of those sugary candied orange slices for good measure, an underwhelmingly malty graininess, and a still hard to detect, wan, and let's just say leafy and earthy bitterness.<br>
<br>
The carbonation is pretty much inert for the most part, barely a frothy tickle to be bargained for, the body a so-so middleweight, but bolstered by that heady saccharine character, so of course it's smooth, smooth, smooth!  It finishes sweet, but on the downswing, as my palate, being North American, is now duly acclimatized, and I now find this not to be all that.<br>
<br>
Yeah, a simple fruit beer, one where the underlying brew is more or less obfuscated, in that it's hard to determine (or just not worth it) if it's even a lager or a blonde ale in there.

Taste:  Malty, bready notes leading to earthy hops in the finish<br>

<br>
I live in Petaluma; I've been drinking 101 North beers for years, even going to their tap room.  I've ordered it on tap from many locations around the north bay and watch the bar tender struggle with pouring a good glass.  The beers have been over-carbonated since the beginning, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was just a one-time mistake from a small brewer, but it's been YEARS of this.  It's just poor brewing at this point and it's no longer acceptable.<br>
<br>
Additionally, every time I go to the tap room, they ONLY have Heroine and Golden Naked available for sale in bombers (or any size).  I've been a few times over the last 3 years, and there's never anything else for sale.  Either their tap room employees are clueless or the person running the business is.  <br>

T - A little saltier on the taste which lets you know it is supposed to be a Gose, but it doesn't have the same pop as other examples of the style. A dry doughy flavor and more of that wheat from the aroma. The only way you know it had orange or lemon was from an acidic zest, but no actual fruit flavor.<br>

<br>
Smell is very good, some good balance and depth here.  Not a hop bomb but appropriately hoppy.  Citrus, tropical and floral hops.  Sweet malts provide a nice balance on the back end.  <br>
<br>
Taste is really excellent.  Much stronger than I expected especially based on the smell, the flavors really step it up to where it's kind of bold.  Hoppier than you'd expect based on the aroma.  It's got excellent citrus flavor, tangerine, blood orange and maybe a bit of clementine.  This follows a nice sweet fresh baked bread flavor provided by the grains.  At the end is some bitterness from the hops again, sort of like a bitter citrus pith garnish.  <br>

Mouthfeel is good as well.  It's surprisingly light on the tongue because it does have a nice long lingering flavor.  Maybe a little less carbonated than it could be, but not much.  Great balance.  Starts of with a bit of citrus hoppyiness going to some sweet bread and buttery in the middle than a bitter finish that's fairly dry.  Great drinkability.  This is a beer that's meant for a growler.  Great beer I hope it's always there when I go to Tenth District.  Great addition to the community.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,421 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 01, 2015",4.25,4.25,4.25,,4.25,4.25,AndyAvalanche

2,90624,"I've revised my reviews down on all of my 101 North beers.<br>
<br>
I live in Petaluma; I've been drinking 101 North beers for years, even going to their tap room.  I've ordered it on tap from many locations around the north bay and watch the bar tender struggle with pouring a good glass.  The beers have been over-carbonated since the beginning, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was just a one-time mistake from a small brewer, but it's been YEARS of this.  It's just poor brewing at this point and it's no longer acceptable.<br>
<br>
Additionally, every time I go to the tap room, they ONLY have Heroine and Golden Naked available for sale in bombers (or any size).  I've been a few times over the last 3 years, and there's never anything else for sale.  Either their tap room employees are clueless or the person running the business is.  <br>
<br>
Heroine is a decent IPA, but it's no longer amateur hour in the craft brew market.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">927 characters</span><br><br>","Jun 05, 2016",2,2,2,-43.8%,2,2,8BaconBits

<br>
The pour was to fill, so it only had around 1/4"" white head atop the bright, clear amber liquid...head died quick, left minimal collar and only a lil lace around the top of the glass....kinda looked like a toasted lager, if that makes sense...<br>
<br>
Toasted cereal in the smell and toasted caramel out the ass in the flavor, though it drank really clean and fairly smooth and had just enough of a light hop flavor to balance the ""nakedness"" of its namesake specialty ingredient. Considering the relative intensity (and I suppose I wasn't expecting it) of the specialty additions, the body seemed lighter and it drank a good bit drier than it tasted. So I guess score one for 101. Not a bad beer.

T:  Like the nose, I find this very neutral.  Nothing really jumps out except bread, cereal grains, and some sweetness.  Which isn't bad, but for some reason doesn't hit that great malty sweet spot that I love.<br>
M/O:  A light to medium body.  Moderate carbonation, just kind of there.  Again, all this isn't bad, and enjoyable enough.  I feel the malt character and body could just be more well defined.<br>
<br>
Certainly a good easy drinker that is malt forward. I find other breweries around town have nailed that great malty vibe a bit better than this.

Taste is fucking sweet. I went into this not knowing what to expect, but expecting a beer. I tasted it and recoiled at the sweetness. This is the first beer I've had that has been labeled ""radler"", so I don't know. I'll take it as intentional, and reset my expectations.<br>
<br>
So yes, it's sweet, like pop, but much flatter. I get mostly an orangey sweetness, but mild, so like a mild orange soda. Not bad, kind of refreshing, good for a hot summer day.<br>

Mouthfeel is flattish, medium, slightly sticky.

Naughty Aud<br>
<br>
Artwork by Alan ForbesBlack as the moonless night, Naughty Aud Imperial Stout boasts a profusion of complexity in flavor and aroma possessed by few other styles of ale.  A sturdy crosshatch of molasses, mocha and caramel malt imbued with soft, luminescent aromas of smoked bourbon and vanilla. Illustrated by the renown artist Alan Forbes, this is an unfiltered ale. Please decant slowly and enjoy responsibly. 8.5% ABV / 74 *IBU.-Joel J Johnson, Brew Master101 North Brewing Co.Petaluma, CA<br>

The whiskey is noticeably different than bourbon. Just isn’t the same quality. Otherwise it is a really thick and nice beer. Vanilla and chocolate. Almost has a peaty, scotch flavor.

A:  Pours a clear blonde/yellow color.  A one finger white head forms and recedes in a minute with light lace.<br>
S:  Grains, slight spice and fruity hops, then finishes with more of a cereal grain aroma.  Not bad for a light Blonde Ale but pretty standard.<br>
T:  More cereal grainy malts than anything.  Some hops build as this warms, and becomes almost fruity like.  Then quickly vanishes to a watery finish.<br>
M/O:  A light body that is thin and watery.  Not as crisp as I would like, and the finish is quick and rather nonexistent.  While they did make a low alcohol accessible to the masses lighter offering.  This style has been done better by other brewers around town.<br>
<br>
A fairly by the books example of a Blonde Ale.  I find it inoffensive, a tad bit boring, but a decent attempt at what they are trying to do.

<br>
Serving type: 12 oz can into a tulip glass. 2017 vintage.<br>
<br>
Pours a deep ebony black, with dark cola colored edges when held up to light. Mocha colored head that dissolves into a perfect unbroken circle of bubbles that persists throughout the drink. This is a beautiful looking beer, right on par for the style of Russian Imperial.<br>
<br>
Initial smell is of upfront whiskey, dark chocolate, roasted malt, milk chocolate, subtle coffee grounds, subtle coconut, with a a subtle dark fruit aroma (prune like). As the beer warms, an almost honey like sweetness starts to permeate the aroma. Residual mocha-like sweetness and coffee grounds become more apparent as the beer warms.<br>
<br>
Taste reflects the smell. Initial moderate whiskey flavors lead into a pleasant roasted malt/coffee ground flavor, whiskey flavors persist throughout the drink. Milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and roasted malt characteristics intermingle throughout the drink. Dark fruit flavors are more apparent during retronasal though not through the drink. Finishes with a lingering flavor of both light whiskey and dark chocolate. Reminds me of a Hershey dark chocolate bar that's been soaking in whiskey for a few hours. Delicious.<br>
<br>
Feel is thick, viscous, chewy, carbonation fits the heavier handed flavors and aromas of this beer. Overall, this is a great beer with great whiskey and dark chocolate aromas and flavors.

4.62,198052,"Brilliant milk stout. Tremendous milk stout. It's YUUUUGE on flavor, and I know milk stouts. I've heard about milk stouts from many many people, and this is a good one. <br>
<br>
Seriously though. It likes like just about every other milk stout you see, and that's not a bad thing. The nose is rather innocuous. I honestly wasn't expecting much after the nose, but I was amazingly surprised. Excellent lactose, chocolate, coffee flavors up front and delicious cinnamon on the backbone. After a moment or two the backbone evolves with the pepper flavor that balances heat and flavor in just the perfect way that leaves your mouth feeling full and vaporous.

3.51,118938,"355ml clear glass bottle.  An unspecified type of beer aged in rum casks, 'Bajan' (Barbados) style.<br>
<br>
This beer pours a clear, pale golden yellow hue, with a teeming tower of puffy, loosely foamy, and nicely frothy eggshell white head, which leaves some randomly splattered lace around the glass as it swiftly abates.<br>
<br>
It smells of bready, crackery pale malt, an underwhelming caramel sweetness, weakly woody light rum notes (the lesser-known alcohol-free sort), a touch of earthy vanilla, and weedy, grassy, and faintly skunky hops.  The taste is more of the same - gritty, grainy pale malt, a wisp of caramel that I now grok as being rum barrel borne, along with its other vanilla and brown sugar inherencies, and fading weedy, mildly citrusy, and grassy hops.<br>
<br>
The carbonation is quite lively in its tacky frothiness, the body a decent medium weight, yet sort of sticky and pithy in its attempt at smoothness.  It finishes a whole lot less sweet than I was expecting - more of a plain grainy and neutered rum joint, as it were.<br>
<br>
Nothing great, but nothing really all that off about this either, save a bit of initial olfactory skank.  The biggest casualty here is the rum, which simply doesn't come across particularly well.  It's there, sure, but in a very stripped-down sense.  And what's with the sub-5% ABV for a barrel-aged affair?  I guess I'm just not on island time, or something.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,390 characters</span><br><br>","Aug 19, 2014",3.25,4,3.5,,3.5,3.5,biboergosum

<br>
A:  Pours a dark black color that is nearly opaque.  A one finger tan head forms with good retention initially and light lace.  That recedes in a second, and not surprisingly considering the ABV. <br>
S:  Rich and deep dark chocolate that lasts forever.  Very sweet up front, with caramel/toffee like malts.  I don't get any barrel character in the nose, but dark chocolate and malts are very good.  If a little simplistic.<br>
T:  Like the nose, this is dark chocolate all the way.  Rich and sweet with a bit of caramel malts in there.  Hardly any roast to speak of, just almost entirely chocolate malts.  There is a touch of tannin like twang towards the end when this warms, but I was hard pressed to tell there was any barrel aging here.<br>
M/O:  A big full body, but not overly viscous at all.  Given the strength and body that is impressive.  Appropriately carbonated and smooth at the same time.  There is a bit of heat, and very much a slow sipper.  While that is to be expected, it is more of a one snifter per sitting every once in a while. <br>
<br>
A big stout for sure.  The barrel is beyond subtle here, and almost nonexistent.  The stout mostly consists of big chocolate and light caramel malts.  While not bad in anyway, and enjoyable for what it is.

Mini-growler fill from the Boise pub tonight... Poured into my new Teku... Beautiful pinkish orange with little head retention or lacing.. Bright REAL strawberry in the nose and on the palate.. lemon lactic notes freshen up the fruitiness.. Like an adult strawberry lemonade.. Strawberry beers are tough to get right and still pack enough fruit in... This one is done well... Would LOVE to see it in bottles at some point.<br>

Smell: Lemon soda aromatics, with just a hint of bready wheat underneath<br>

Taste: Tart lemon flavors dominate, with soda sweetness building in the middle; a nice balance between the tart and sweet flavors linger into the finish<br>

<br>
A:  Pours a near opaque black color.  A small tan head forms with little retention, and not much lace either.<br>
S:  Sugary sweet with chocolate.  Cinnamon and allspice are strong.  Not much else, and all powerfully up front.<br>
T:  Again, really sweet and sugary up front.  That leads to some chocolate, but a much more pronounced cinnamon/allspice flavor that basically takes over.  Some earthy bitterness, and green peppers.  Not bad for what it is, but just to busy and all up front.  Not a lot of nuance after the initial hit, and it all hits the second I take a sip.   <br>
M/O:  A big full body, with moderate carbonation.  Viscous, inky, and sticky.  A big stout, and the sweetness, allspice character, and viscosity/stickiness makes this a really slow sipper.  Not something I am particularly looking to come back to.<br>
<br>
Big, viscous, sweet, and very much of the spiced variety.  I can see how people will love this on a sip, tasting, or a one off glass then done.

A: super pale, almost colorless. Absolutly clear. A little pure white head that fell to an adequate cap and a good ring.<br>

S: fruity, a hint of pineapple. Caramel sweetness on the nose, like a very light toffee. No hops on the nose. Just sweet sweet malt.<br>

T: sweet, not as sweet as the nose but caramely malt. The strong hops comes in on the taste but not overpowering. Finishes a little bitter and has a lot of good hoppy flavor.<br>

3.04,45496,"First go from this brewery. Pour appears black until the light hits, giving off a deep Ruby/Brown hue, accompanied by a very thin head that fades quite fast, along with very minimal lace.<br>
<br>
Smells of roasted grains, malt and caramel. Some vanilla as it warms. Following through on the taste spectrum is roasted grain, malts and caramel, accompanied by faint chocolate and grass. Some light banana from the yeast. Slightly nutty. Very thin and close to watery; gives off an almost dark soda-like feel. Smooth, dry.<br>
<br>
This one, for me, missed out on the rich, deep roasty aspect that I love in the Schwarzbier style. I can see they went for a different take on this one, but the styles seemed to clash and cause it to fall short. Not a bad beer, but there are a plethora of better ones of this style out there.

4.29,297953,"Thanks to Sharpski for this bottle. According to the label: Collaboration between Tonya Cornett and Sean Paxton; Created 2012, released 2016; 16.6%ABV. 11.8oz bottle poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solidly opaque dark ruby color, in fact, the only light is at the very edges, much like a thick stout. The beer had good carbonation, but had no head or lacing.<br>
<br>
As to be expected by from a beer pushing 17%, there was a strong alcohol scent upon opening. Definite Port scent on top of the pleasant basic Quad aroma. Perhaps a bit of cinnamon (as mentioned on label) but maybe not.  Whooo boy! on the tongue. Some warming alcohol, some wine, a solid hit of chocolate (also, as mentioned on label) and a hint of cinnamon heat at the back. Not as boozy as I thought it would be. Very pleasant overall flavors.<br>
<br>
The body was as full as you would expect, with a silky mouthfeel. The finish, while nowhere near dry, is not as sweet as expected. Drinkability was surprisingly good; smooth, clean, and no burn at all. Overall, excellent. An absoloute must-buy if you ever see it.

Even more surprised by the taste, which is not only citrusy, but also juicy and sweet. Flavors of orange, pear and papaya contribute to an odd mesh of fruity sweetness. There is some peppery bitterness, but it is quite minimal and doesn’t provide so much balance. <br>
First impressions are that this is more of an IPL considering how hoppy it is and for its light lager body. However, although it has a certain crispness to it, it seems to lack the dryness of a true pils. Neither an IPA, Pilsner, or IPL, perhaps they are stretching for a new style? A New England IPL?

Appearance: deep amber hue with a rather murky body. Head is a thin finger of creamy tan foam with just a little hint of an amber cast. Actually quite nice.<br>

Smell: citrusy hop character with a somewhat sweet caramel note underneath. Simple, but nicely executed. <br>
<br>
Taste: smooth caramel up front, followed by some slightly toasty and biscuity malt flavors. The hops then chime in, quite citrusy (more lemony than grapefruity) in character. Bitterness is moderate and quite reasonable for the style. It's actually working for me.<br>

Mouthfeel: very smooth and creamy; I quite like it.<br>

Notes from 06/22/14<br>
<br>
A: Lightly hazed burnt sienna color. Has that orangey amber look to it with a half finger width of khaki suds frothing over top. Modest hang time with just a few choppy dots and swaths of lace left behind. <br>
<br>
S: Heavy spiced hops with grassy herbals and a light tropical fruit note. It has this passion fruit and guava thing going on which is nice. Very spiced up however. I get some ephemeral biscuit malt underneath. Fairly nice and hoppy aromas. <br>
<br>
T: Taste has a firm bready malt biscuit there but with equal parts hops to balance. I get a good mix of grass with spice as well as some grapefruit and tropical spiced guava fruit. There is a low amount of actual bitterness with a touch of astringent pucker at the finish. The alcohol is really well masked making this nicely balanced and rather tasty. <br>
<br>
M: The mouth feel is creamy on the tongue with a moderate to lighter body. Some light astringency constricts the palate a touch. Good drying at the finish which is rather clean overall.<br>
<br>
D: This IPA won’t blow minds with its hefty toasted malt bill but it has some nice hoppy notes with a bit of spiced tropical flare to it. All in all some good balance across the boards. Would definitely have another but probably not something I will be searching out when in NorCal.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,334 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 24, 2014",3.5,3.75,3.75,,3.75,3.75,Nugganooch

3.38,93805,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass.<br>
<br>
Appearance: on first pour, my large 20-oz imperial pint glass has about two fingers of beer on the bottom with easily six or seven fingers of foam on top. Clearly something is amiss here; I'm guessing an unexpected bottle refermentation. Color is a medium gold with a light haze and a strong effervescence (surprise!). <br>
<br>
Smell: citrusy and grapefruity, but not in a hop-character way -- more like, in a fruit juicy way. I also had this beer at Portland Brewers Fest a couple months ago and there it was marketed more like a radler -- they started with a strong Pilsner base and mixed it with fruit juice. It certainly seemed to be the case then, and that impression is certainly not diminished now. I feel like in the bottle, though, it's not as fresh-smelling as straight out of the keg.<br>
<br>
Taste: sweet and refreshing like a radler should be -- kind of like candied grapefruit. I actually kind of like the style. Runaway carbonation notwithstanding, this beer certainly doesn't taste infected or anything; we're probably just seeing the effects of added juice at bottling. Aside from the inconvenience, I like the overall effect.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel: quite light. Not much going on here.<br>
<br>
Overall: this stuff is incredibly drinkable. I mean, it's nice now, sitting in my office late at night, but in the 90-degree Portland sun it was indispensable.

(Are they really owned by AB Inbev per BA's Place page?  10 Barrel seems too small for AB; besides the 150+ active beers, they have several restaurants... all of which makes it tough to meet AB's financial criteria.)<br>
<br>
At any rate, this IPA is kinda of an average Joe. Certainly Looks that way for the style. Smells combine will the floral and piney with a fruity, sweet malt. Taste is largely the same, but mid-palate the bitter hops take over. But, I guessed that might happen. So, I planned ahead and ordered a spicy dish and  it all worked out.<br>

Probably one and done on an average Joe.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">658 characters</span><br><br>","May 26, 2018",3.5,3.75,3.5,-4.3%,4.25,3.75,Beginner2

<br>
Smell - Strong notes of roasted coffee, chocolate, earthy and floral hoppiness. <br>
<br>
Taste - Milk chocolate to start, then strong notes of coffee roast and earthy hop bitterness. Dark and Baker's chocolate and more roast hit mid-taste and linger into the finish, delivering a mostly bitter aftertaste.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - Medium to full in body with fair carbonation. Smooth with a semi-dry finish.<br>
<br>
Overall - Flavorwise, it reminds me quite a bit of the Rogue Shakespeare Stout. Doesn't quite have the silky smoothness of the latter, but that's the difference between a regular stout and an oatmeal stout.

<br>
Aroma of pineapple immediately lifts up to the olfactory, even at the pour; further analysis follows with stone fruits and more veiny pineapple. <br>
<br>
Flavor is of sour and rindy tropical fruit to start, namely pineapple, getting the passion fruit here as well; as it drifts to the middle of the tongue the malts come into play as a pale counterpart, and then it finishes on white grapefruit and orange pith. <br>
<br>
Feel is more chalky or pasty than I'd like, it sort of clings onto the mouth and doesn't let go easily even though I want it to. This is one of those more rare circumstances where I'd prefer the beer to be a bit more thin, a bit more watery, just to help it along and not linger around with those rindy off-notes. <br>
<br>
Overall another average beer from 10 Barrel. If you're really that curious, try it for yourself, otherwise move along. It's not a pineapple bomb, and it's not a real hoppy ale...just kind of floats in the superfluous middle.

Nose shows big floral hoppiness with a lesser grassy/earthy hop note... Toasty malt essence helps IMO accentuate the fresh hop notes in this one.<br>

<br>
- Medium cloudy dirty molasses brown. Minimal head which settles to a rather spotty and bubbly floating mass not paying attention to either portion of the glass. Nice bubbly ring sits quietly. <br>
<br>
Smell: (3.5)<br>
<br>
- Lot's of grain. Bready and biscuit grain with a touch of sweet caramel, molasses, and brown sugar. A tart ale yeast represents itself as well as an influx of herbal and grassy hops. Nothing too floral or citrus-like which I like. Pretty much smells ale-like, and beery.<br>
<br>
Taste: (4.5)<br>
<br>
- Lovely balance. Grassy earthy herbal hops play a huge roll in bittering this beer. The balance is astounding against the grainy, wheaty, and bready malt. The malt isn't so caramel at all. This is a tasty and balanced number. Super high marks in flavor. The bitterness is very separated from the flavor. <br>
<br>
Mouth Feel: (4.0)<br>
<br>
- Lovely medium body, very well drinkable, and perfectly carbonated with what seems to be a pretty standard ale yeast. It is a dry brown, and leaves the tongue a tad dry. It's a touch cloying, and is a chewy number without the heavy caramel sweetness like so many other browns. <br>
<br>
Overall: (4.0)<br>
<br>
- This beer is damn good. It's is a little more dry and bitter compared to what most of us know as a brown ale. It is a bit stronger, with no notice in its drinkability, and finishes perfectly.

Appearance:  rich orange hue with a surprisingly light haze and a moderate effervescence.  Head is a finger of creamy ivory foam which leaves a nice thorough lace on the glass as it dissipates.  Quite attractive!<br>
<br>
Smell:  strong and sweet with a definite pumpkin aroma and a big, oaky attitude.  There are indeed rum notes, and the oak is strong in a way that makes me think of a sour, although there's not a strictly sour element to it.  Nicely complex!<br>
<br>
Taste:  big and rich pumpkin up front, with a very solid maltiness.  There is a traditional pumpkin spice here, but it's easily stood up to by the barrel.  The overall effect is muddled, but it's still a very good beer indeed.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel:  medium body with a good carbonation and concomitant creaminess.  I dig it.<br>

The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. The is a attractive enough, as I pick up vanilla, licorise, some light malted vinegar and black coffee. There's some underlying whiskey in the nose as well, but it's not overdone, and certainly doesn't come close to dominationg the aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with almonst none of the whiskey flavor present. The amount of hoppy bittterness comes through much more prominantly on the palate, and it balances and dries up the moderate sweetness very well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, vanilla and licorise finish. As the beer warmed up a bit, I also seemed to pick up some dark chocolate on the nose and palate as well. Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile, though certainly you can tell it's up there a bit.<br>

<br>
There's a lot of pumpkin spice on the nose and palate, and I thought the rum flavor blended well with the spice and underlying sweetness in this beer.   It gave the beer something of a buttery, pumpkin eggnog flavor, that was nice.  Yet for all that, it just seemed like there was something missing in this beer, or maybe the base beer wasn't a great choice (seemed like a strong ale, or aged ale).  Alcohol was well integrated into the flavor profile; the beer wasn't at all heavy or hot on the palate.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I thought this was a pretty good beer, but just not a great beer.  Not sure this is something I need to order again any time soon.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">684 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 01, 2014",,,,-2.2%,,,John_M

Appearance: light golden-orange hue with a bit of haze and a moderately strong effervescence. Head poured three fingers of frothy ivory foam and has pretty good retention. I quite like it.<br>
<br>
Smell: earthy, floral, citrusy and fruity hops atop a relatively sweet malt base. Good, but there's something else in there, like an overripe or sickly sweet fruity character which isn't strong but is present enough to be a distraction. <br>
<br>
Taste: fruity and citrusy with a fair amount of acidity in the works, although it's not necessarily tart. Finishes off with a good, balanced bitterness. The overripe character from the aroma is thankfully absent, although the overall impression is a bit homebrew-ey. Not terrible, though.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel: medium body with a good, rocky carbonation. Refreshing.<br>

3.68,45496,"One of the beers in a mixed pack from 10 Barrel that I picked up.  I'm wondering about the name... isn't Schwarzbier a lager?  Why call it an ale?  I've always wondered that about Dead Guy, too.  I personally like it when breweries in this area of the country branch out and brew interesting lagers; if anything I'm more likely to grab one off the shelf if it looks different than the run of the mill ales around it.<br>
<br>
It pours dark brown but allows more light through than most brews of this color.  Not much head faded quickly and leaves scant lace.  Looks like black coffee to me, actually.<br>
<br>
Nose is pleasant but faint.  A big inhale yields something kind of bready, yeasty and sweet that reminds me of overnight waffles that my wife makes with yeast leavening, with syrup on top.<br>
<br>
Flavors are also pleasant and understated.  Bready malts with sweetness like molasses and faintly earthy hops.  Low carbonation and light body is a good mouthfeel match to the flavors.  This is the only non-IPA in the mixed pack from 10 Barrel, and it's a nice change of pace from the hops. (But Joe IPA was my favorite overall.)<br>
<br>
10 Barrel must have been in a quirky mood when naming this beer.  Not only is ""Ale"" in the name puzzling to me since I believe this is a lager, a play on ""sinister"" doesn't fit either.  This is a mild-mannered, easy going drink that would play nice with a variety of food.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,387 characters</span><br><br>","May 15, 2015",3.75,3.5,3.75,,3.5,3.75,josiahschlender

Pours a hazy reddish-orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, grapefruit juice, pine needle, and earthy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, citrus zest, pine needle, and earthy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel.

S- The smell of this one is one is straight boozy pumpkin right form the beginning. Starts with the pumpkin dominating the nose before some spices creep in. The spices include mainly nutmeg, with just a touch of cinnamon. Rum and booze notes also mix in and with the pumpkin and spices to provide an overall impression of a drunken pumpkin pie on the nose.<br>
<br>
T- The taste of this one goes pretty much the same as the scent does. The beginning is nothing but imperial pumpkin ale with strong pumpkin flavors followed by the nutmeg and cinnamon again. Then the rum flavor moves in after the pumpkin ale flavors. The rum flavor is dull and somewhat bitter, but in a boozy way. Lingering on the tongue is a mix of rum and pumpkin.<br>

Deep muddy ruddy amber. More orange in the light. Nice almond-meat head, though small. settles in as a thin fog across the top, with breakthrough patches of bubbles.<br>
<br>
Nose starts off almost a touch sour, surprisingly enough. There's some creamy sweet note running underneath, that I'm thinking is from pumpkin. There's some sweet notes of rum coming through, too, but it's much more of a background than I was expecting: I'm cool with this.<br>
<br>
Starts off aggressive, though I can't quite place the flavour: the fine pointed carbonation is also kind of... out of order. Like, mixed up, not like not working. Usually I get the flavour and then the carbonation comes in to kind of support it, but here I swear the carbonation is what hits your tongue before anything else. This initially made me concerned that it was going to be an overcarbonated mess like a glass of old orange juice. This surprisingly early entrance of carbonation though quickly dissipates and give way to a creamy thick body. I kind of like this new twist. I don't know if any of that makes sense, but it's the best I can come up with.<br>
As far as what it actually tastes like, drinking it is still accompanied by what I can only describe as a mildly funky aroma, but I don't get that in the flavour hardly at all. It starts off a creamy sweet, oaky, with a it of vanilla and faint faint pumpkin meat. The rum comes in next, and brings with it a noticeable alcohol flavour, but that's what rum does, I suppose. The finish is smoothe, but certainly takes its cues primarily from the rum. Rum is not my favourite of the alcohols, but I'm not wholly against it. I can appreciate what it does here, and for someone who likes rum a little more, this would probably really hit the spot. As for me, I still really enjoy it, but prefer bourbon barrels to rum barrels.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,846 characters</span><br><br>","Nov 17, 2014",4.25,3.75,4,-1%,3.75,4.25,kemoarps

I am a HUGE fan of mosaic hops so I'm really looking forward to this...<br>
<br>
Pours a hazy gold body with a bone white head. Lots of thin lacing, Decent retention.<br>
<br>
Ah, the familiar  mosaic hop scent. I have heard it described as smelling like onion or feet (dirty sneakers). Mosaic hops have always had that pungent, almost yeasty scent. This one doesn't disappoint!  Big mosaic presence. Overall; scent is pretty prominent. (and this beer is almost 2 months old) <br>
<br>
Booze, Booze, Booze!  Taste has a little  malt presence that I didn't smell  earlier, but the (10%) alcohol is fairly pervasive. While I enjoyed the 95 IBU bitterness.  It comes across as more of a dry alcohol type of bitterness. Enjoyable taste but a little  boozy.<br>
<br>
Feel  is slightly balanced by the malt. But at 10% ABV  it's a pretty dry feel that's making me pucker like eating sour worms...<br>
<br>
Overall;   Can't really get away from the 10% ABV but as a Mosaic hops fan it was worth checking out! But after one 22 ounce beer I think I'm ready for a nap...Piano Man has left the building!!!<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,126 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 15, 2017",4,4,4.5,,5,4.25,pianoguy

The aromas are vibrant pithy citrus zest... grapefruit zest exactly.. not getting much in the way of malts honestly.<br>
<br>
Again, very hoppy on the palate... citrus with a bit of sorta tropical fruitiness... not nearly as bitter as the nose would lead you to believe .. a decent amount of pale malt with a dusting of toast helps carry the fresh hoppiness from front to back... <br>
<br>
Body is a solid medium with plenty of carbonation that somehow still leans toward a smooth mouthfeel... even oily.<br>
<br>
This is pretty damn good.... Very fresh tasting... I am really digging it and will certainly buy it again as long as it is fresh and on shelves.<br>

3.82,45496,"Appearance - Pours black with cola brown edging. The head is khaki colored and peaks at just under a finger's width. Retention is average at best, giving way to a broken layer of surface suds. Lacing is small and spotty with little stick.<br>
<br>
Smell - Light notes of roasted malt and some cola-like sweetness. Hints of milk chocolate.<br>
<br>
Taste - Follows the nose. General malt sweetness with hints of cola, chocolate, and very light coffee roast. Subtle notes of fruity esters and maybe even a hint of vanilla and anise in there. A light, 'brightly dark' flavor profile, if that makes any sense.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Lightly silky texture, delivering a smooth, easy drinking experience.<br>
<br>
Overall - Pretty good black lager / scharzbier, especially condsidering the style. It's a difficult style to pull off, IMO, because it doesn't quite excel in any particular area. This one has some uniqueness, and it's undoubtedly due to the ale yeast used. Don't go out of your way for it, but definitely something to try if readily available.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,065 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 17, 2015",4,3.75,3.75,,3.5,4,TheSixthRing

3.72,110513,"Appearance- Pours up a good amount of head which has okay retention. The head is a light beige/tan while the body is a medium to dark amber which appears as a medium amber/honey in the light. Some haziness. Lacing is sheeting that extends somewhat from the surface of the beer. <br>
<br>
Nose- Very warm and inviting, very citrus. Oranges and lemons plus grapefruit paired with a slight mustiness. Some very well-rounded, mellow cat piss. Light notes of cherry and peaches around the edges. Very juicy and very promising. Some caramel. Slight matchstick, papaya, and burnt caramel are revealed by swirling. <br>
<br>
Taste- Fairly representative of the nose but I wish the citrus and fruit notes were stronger. They are all there (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, peaches, cherry, even some melon) but they are dull in comparison to the nose. Caramel tends toward a slight burnt quality, some popcorn but this fades on a subsequent taste. Some pine and resin on the finish with a touch of spice. No real linger which makes the beer pretty easy drinking at this point. The hops have some complexity but they are fairly tame- more subtle than subdued. Right now it's drinking as a solid, good beer and I imagine that's where it's going to stay. Good balance and integration. The mellow flavor profile is aided by the softness of the mouthfeel. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel- The labeling indicates that this may have been an attempt at a nitro beer. While isn't quite as smooth as that it is still pretty smooth with light carbonation. Between light and medium bodied. <br>
<br>
Drinkability- Fairly easygoing and while not the juice bomb the nose seemed to indicate, it's still a nice, low-key IRA. Average craft beer price. Probably wouldn't buy it again unless I saw it on nitro. That would be interesting. <br>
<br>
Overall- Seems like a solid, good beer that is a rounder take on the IRA style. Enjoyable enough and worth a try. Probably not a repurchase though.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,911 characters</span><br><br>","Feb 15, 2014",4,3.5,3.75,-3.9%,4,3.5,artoolemomo

T- Just a touch of the sweet raspberries hit the tongue first before the fruit turns tart and balances out. After the raspberries subside, the base beer's tartness is readily apparent.

M- very highly carbonated and crushable, just like the name insinuates.<br>

Overall, this is a pretty good starter sour that still displays its fruit very well. The level of sour is satisfying, but gets a little strong in the middle of the drink.

Pretty good, just not for me.<br>

A: Hazy yellow/orange body with a significant amount of carbonation slowly rising; a huge, fluffy &amp; soapy white head fades away relatively fast.<br>
<br>
S: Fruit flesh, a bit funky and almost rotten at times. Lemonade, tart, sugary essence, bready sweetness. Not a great nose to me...<br>
<br>
T: Taste follows the nose, but is a bit better; carbonated lemonade meets a hefeweizen. Somewhat tart and somewhat sugary-sweet. Finish is clean with more lemon. Refreshing and pretty highly drinkable.<br>

MF: Not overcarbed, medium to high carbonation is appropriate. Lighter medium body but not quite 'light'.<br>

<br>
I'm a pretty big fan of the Berliner Weissbier style, which maybe explains why I didn't care for this. I found the German sparkle party to be much more sour than is typical for the style, with the sour compoent completely dominating the flavor profile. The beer came off as a sour, wild ale, wheat beer, and I just didn't dig it. Otherwise, it looked and smelled OK (there was some light sour on the nose, but the flavor profile was a complete shock - that's how sour this beer is), and I appreciated the low alcohol. However, there is no way I'd want to order this again. <br>

4.26,93805,"I heard that this was a sour ale, but I don't think it's called one technically. It's based off a Berliner Weiss, which is an actual sour, me loving sours i decided to see if it would scratch the sour itch (haha) and pick a 6 pack up for 9.39. <br>
<br>
A- pale straw rich gold color.<br>
<br>
S- smells honestly just like some domestic mass produced pale lager. Or the taste of a pale lager more like. Sweet like yeasts.<br>
<br>
T- starts off grapefruity sweet and then dives into a mellow sourness. Fricken delish! Then another touch of grapefruit on the long finish and then super pale malts linger for quite awhile. This tastes almost like a sour but then typical beer flavors kick in, such a perfect mix!<br>
<br>
M-quite carbonated, makes for it being pretty refreshing.<br>
<br>
O- well, I was sceptical. But this beer blew me away! This will be my beer for summer 2013. If you like sours, I'm sure you will LOVE this one as I do! Sours tend to get pretty spendy so for a 6 pack of this costing 9.39ish, I'm very willing to pick this stuff up all the time. Get yourself some!!!

Pours a pretty hazy orange with a muddy purple tinge when held to a light... short lived white head still leaves behind pretty okay lacing.<br>
<br>
Nose is pretty awesome... fruitastic mix that reminds me of ripe strawberries and the essence of Concord Grapes... <br>
<br>
Flavor is tart and not as acidic as most sours, but the fruitiness moves through and leaves behind a tannic note that I associate with black currants...<br>
<br>
I don't know that I believe this is 8.5%... in fact, I sorta doubt it.. This is surprisingly drinkable and shows no real flaws... Just a nice fruity Berliner.<br>

Citrus notes upfront, mainly mango with a touch of buttery bread. Not sure what to make of it aroma-wise. <br>

Clean, crisp and chewy with very good use of hops. It's not BITTER and provides a good contrast between a hoppier IPA and mellower pale ale. <br>

This was a prime CANdidate for a Crack! &amp; inverted Glug in celebration of their arrival in PA. This produced two-plus fingers of foamy, fizzy, eggshell-white head that quickly fizzled its way out of existence. Color was a brilliant Straw-Yellow (SRM = &gt; 2, &lt; 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a light biscuit maltiness along with a lightly grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel was slightly thin. The taste was clean, lightly malty sweet, slightly grassy with Saaz hops.

The nose is very malty, with aromas of caramel, brown sugar, and some molasses. Piney hop notes, with some floral tones as well. A little touch of grapefruit sweetness is also there.<br>

Malt forward again, with flavors of caramel and toasted bread. There is also some vague, apple fruit flavors. Light citrus hops, with a floral essence. Piney hops with some juicy grapefruit come up towards the end, and the finish has a dry and bitter finish, with a red ale essence.<br>
<br>
The finish has some of the qualities of a red ale that I don't like (a weird mixture of malt sweetness and pine bitterness), but that is easily forgiven. An IPA to try out if you're looking for something different, as this is kind of a Red Ale/Amber/IPA hybrid.

The smell is of caramel/toffee with dark fruit (plum) and an earthy tone.<br>
<br>
The taste is of sweet caramel/toffee (hint of chocolate?) sweetness balanced by a bitterness that almost clashes in the initial taste. I like the malt profile here and can appreciate the balance, though here it might be a bit much for what the brew is, and puts a bit of a dent in it. In-between scores for the taste, I'll go with the higher of the two scores I have in mind for it.<br>

Although alcohol does show, it is malty smooth and holds a medium body.<br>

The malt flavor is very good. I love hops and appreciate the balance to keep it from being too sweet, but here the bitter flavor detracts a bit. Still, it's a decent brew.

4.16,90624,"Tasty flagship from a worthy new brewery - combining the coppery-malty East Coast style of IPA with the hoppy character of the West Coast. This beer reminds me somewhat of Victory's Hop Devil, but with the creamier feel favored by West Coast brewers.<br>
<br>
Pours a clear coppery with a moderate head that falls quickly, leaving decent lacing. The aroma is sticky hoppy with a citrusy edge over a somewhat milky character, like a creamcicle. The flavor is rich and hoppy - resiny and sticky, bitter like a blood orange, with a firm but not assertive malt backbone and an icecream feel on the tongue. The bitterness is confined mostly to the attack, with only a little prickle on the top of the throat on the finish.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">709 characters</span><br><br>","May 09, 2013",4.25,3.75,4.25,,4,4.25,Seanibus

Yeast, Bread, Earthy <br>
<br>
Clearly this beer is just above the benchmark for this style. Hits all the right notes, with a very lively level of carbonation that produces a towering head. Fruitiness and spice are more subtle than other flavors, which is a great thing, as too much banana and clove can just be a distraction. Drinkability is through the roof. Highly recommended. <br>

Pale and caramel malts start the smell. Some spice and citrus follow with a hint of pine. Not really West Coast, or NorCal as described, but still smell like a pretty good IPA.<br>

Interesting, almost roasted caramel start, quickly followed by citrus. It's more of an orange peel than a fruit citrus. Some grassy hops and pine aftertaste show up. There is a spicy note to this, the good gentleman at Healthy Spirits thought it might be Rye. I think he might be right. Whatever it is that adds that spicy kick, it's a nice addition. Carbonation is a little heavy for the thickness of the beer, but not terrible.<br>

2.21,230291,"I saw this at the store and was really excited because a pineapple/passionfruit beer sounds really tasty and interesting so I bought the variety 12 pack which said it included 3 bottles each of the IPA, Apocalypse IPA, Sinistor black ale, and the seasonal beer. I assumed the seasonal beer would be the Pina, but when I got home and opened the box, it turned out to be the Riding Solo APA instead, which I guess must have been the spring seasonal release. So I was really disappointed to not have the Pina, but was very pleasantly surprised to find I really really liked the Riding Solo, as well as all three of the other beers. This heightened my expectations for the pina, because now I knew 10 barrel brews some incredibly tasty beer, and I assumed Pina would be no exception, so I went back to the store to buy a 6-pack. Unfortunately I was wrong.<br>
<br>
L: Murky amber color with a thin-ish head. To me it looks like watered down apricot juice, but I'm colorblind, so take that with a grain of salt.<br>
S: In a word, unpleasant. Smells like rotting fruit. Not a super strong smell, but definitely not a good one.<br>
T: Not much taste. Slightly sweeter than an average beer of this abv. KInd of an unbalanced maltiness- I don't know just a sort of mediocre beer taste. Maybe a little bit of fruitiness on the tail end but if I didn't already know there was fruit juice in it, and hadn't sniffed it before taking a shwill, I probably would have never guessed this was a fruit beer.<br>
F: Kind of thin and watery, yet cloying aftertaste.<br>
O: Perhaps I'm grading it a bit harshly since I had such high expectations, but honestly its just not very good. The smell is pretty gross, and it really doesn't taste much like fruit. It's really a very mediocre beer.

Has a thin weak head that fades fast like so many cask ales. Body is a hazy yet vibrant orange.<br>
<br>
Aroma evokes more genuine blood orange than probably any beer I've ever encountered... it's a difficult note to make seem authentic, but damnit if they didn't nail it. Pungent and inviting. One of the freshest aromas in a beer I've ever experienced. Suggests a bitter yet fresh as fuck beer with a floral hop profile mingling with rich blood orange to good effect.<br>

Taste doesn't quite hold up to the aroma, offering simplistic blood orange fruit and fruity hop flavours atop a pale malt foundation.<br>

The blood orange added in secondary makes the aroma terrific, but the taste doesn't deliver on the fantastic aroma's promises, leaving this competent but disappointing. Add blood orange in primary too! More pulpy fruity flavours could only help, and I'd love this if the hop flavours rose to the level of pungency that it needs.<br>

Actually tasty stuff. Hadn’t tried it before.<br>
It is malty, nicely balanced, and has a stinging characteristic that can be described as medicinal, but it’s flavorful to sip, just a well-made DIPA. When it seems it may end too dry, it doesn’t quite get that far. But it is a dry bite of a finish. The malt backbone does this one well. There’s that malty tea flavor I’ve come to like in DIPA malts, albeit an herbal tea in that sense.

A-The beer is light honey in color with just a bit of haze when held in the light. A fat finger of nearly-white foam sits on top for about two minutes before fading out. The head is clingy and dense at first and leaves a chunk or two behind on the glass.<br>
<br>
S-The aroma is an interesting hoppy mixture of fruit and dry, raspy bitter notes. On the fruit side, I sniff lime, lemongrass, some berry notes that I can't quite place. There is not much in the way of malts here, just a hint of pale bread and crackers.<br>
<br>
T-The taste does not follow the smell as much as usual. There is a light sugary sweetness here and a bit of a paper flavor, both of which are likely a result of the beer's advanced age, but there is also a more pine-y and medicinal aspect to the hops. The beer still suggests lime and some berry fruit, but there is a hint of alcohol on the finish that amplifies the leafy side of the hops.<br>
<br>
M-The body is light to medium in weight with an almost creamy carbonation. Drinks easy.<br>

Showcases the tropical character of Mosaic well but eschews its superior subtle blueberry note. Pale malts balance out any hop bitterness. Mango, dried guava, papaya, floral hop flavour.<br>

Nice depth of flavour.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel is refreshing. Smooth, wet, well-carbonated.<br>

Drinkable and enjoyable, though its hop pungency could be improved. I'd definitely take this over Community's Mosaic IPA in terms of the local market, but if you're brewing a Mosaic hopped IPA in Texas you'll always be in the shadow of Lone Pint's Yellow Rose, and this doesn't quite measure up. Definitely worth trying, and a beer I'd revisit if offered in sixers at a fair price.<br>

Well-executed. Soft wheat provides the foundation with leavening 2-row in there so it isn't gummy. Coriander spice is evident, harmonizing nicely with the estery Belgian yeast. Hints of cracked grains/grains of paradise. I get lemon peel but apparently grapefruit peel is utilized...I don't find it. Remarkably well-balanced.<br>

Refreshing, smooth, and wet. A softer more delicate mouthfeel would help it rival the greats in the style.<br>

Aroma is mainly what you'd expect: roasty bordering on burnt, maybe a touch of ash, leading into a bit of acerbic finish. I almost get a touch of vinegar, that I'm hoping is more related to the recently washed windows than the beer,a but I""m not convinced.<br>
<br>
Given my impressions of the nose, it's surprisingly smoothe and light once it hits your tongue. Comes on easy with a creamy (both in feel and flavour) approach that toys with the idea of going bitter about halfway through, teasing the tastebuds (had to put the alliteration in there somewhere...), but never fully commits, sticking more towards lighter roasty notes and that impressively smoothe soft body. Not as thin as I expected either, more just lusciously soft but still thick, like a body pillow. It still stays with the roasted grains as promised, but the ashy bitter note is much more subdued on the palate than on the nose (though it still comes through in a pleasantly surprising bitter/dry finish that lingers. <br>
<br>
I wasn't sure what to expect approaching this one, and I clearly didn't read the description on the bottle which clearly identifies it as being a modified schwarzbier as opposed to the CDA I was anticipating. This is not a bad thing: far from it. While I don't have a ton of experience with schwarzbiers and they're not my favourite style (especially in the dark category), this one is enjoyable. I was wary as I began my decent into it, but by the finish it demonstrated something I didn't even know I was looking for. Tasty.

T:  almost 1:1 following the nose with a minor adjustment -- a little more tart earthy flavor and toasted cranberries and a little less fingernail polish remover; as it warms and the palate adjusts, a bit of raspberry and blackberry, the more tart ones that haven't found their sweetness yet; as it warms more, some sweetness shows up just often enough to really make this tasty ... it's like those few grains of salt or sugar that bring out the flavors even more<br>

F:  lightweight but filled out by good carbonation ... very easy to sip but also easy to handle a midsize quaff; not watery but definitely light; perfect ... as good as my favorite American-made farmhouse ales and wilds with the bigger ABV in a lighter vessel<br>
<br>
O:  wonderful ... a treat of a beer for my particular tastes buds, for it's very reminiscent of a Flanders red or oud bruin with the nice toasted malt flavors blending into the sour flavors, and I love those styles and that mix; when those toasted cranberries offer up some sweetness, my goodness!  you get some raspberry/blackberry flavor and want to start drinking it like it's a 3% kriek lambic.

Mid-palate brings a moderate bitterness &amp; serious drying, a touch sweeter than I normally like. Bitterness lingers. I’m going to need a post-beer saliva transplant. Pretty easy to sip. <br>
<br>
So dry I could use this as a towel, &amp; tasty besides. Very good brew.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">695 characters</span><br><br>","Sep 05, 2015",4,3.5,4,-5.6%,3.5,4,maximum12

2.26,93370,"Looks quite nice with a big foam on the clear yellow brew. Plenty of spritz in the mouth. Smell is rather acidic and not at all hoppy. The foam even has good retention. Surprisingly thin body with an unpleasant oiliness.<br>
<br>
Flavor is an immediate eye-opener. There is some sweetness, which is more like batrley malt than a wheat, and then too much acidity. There is plenty of citrus all right, but it's distinctly lemony orange juice and grapefruit juice. Aftertaste is a long, harsh bitter burn. It doesn't taste like hops. <br>
<br>
I would be curious to try this on tap, but I would stay away from the bottles. It's on their current list of beers so it must not always be this awful. It doesn't quite tast infected, but it's an odd and undrinkable citrus acidity.

Aroma has a nice thick boozy maltiness. A bit of a banana note with the fruitiness. Altogether quite pleasant and balanced.<br>
<br>
Taste has some initial malt with a defined crisp fruity edge. Mild sourness. Comes in with a bit more acidity later. Predominated by thick roasty malts, and some apples. Fairly straightforward, and started pretty bland, but developed more character gradually. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel is okay, a bit on the thin side. Carbonation is pretty light, drinkability is pretty okay.<br>

Definitely different. Good example, this beer is fine, but not enticing enough to really go buy more. Refreshing and crisp but taste is a bit bland and straightforward.

There’s a little bit of whiskey flavor here and it’s nicely woven into the whole beer.

4.07,43534,"poured from 32 oz. half growler into tulip (half growler filled Saturday, Aug. 26, 2017, at Harvey Washbangers in Hurricane Harvey-induced downpour)<br>
<br>
L:  murky gold, about as dark as gold can get without adding amber, like a dull light bronze; pushes up late-percolating creamy head of foam about 3/4 to a full inch tall; keeps thick collar and most of a skin; light sticking, no lacing<br>
<br>
S:  hoppy ... green hops, grassy, a little lime ... citrus note is strong, grapefruit ... yes, as it warms, more and more grapefruit; biscuit malt under the thick layer of hops, very subtle<br>
<br>
T:  mix of grapefruit, generic citrus hop flavor with a more pronounced biscuit malt flavor, almost bready malt; hops are juicy and only lightly bitter and are really smoothed out by that malt sweetness; bitterness shows up in aftertaste, lingering grapefruit peel, almost earthy<br>
<br>
F:  ale soft, almost slick, feels a bit light but there's enough carbonation to add a piece of heft to it; not sure if it lost a lot of carbonation overnight in the half growler, but ... well ... how shall we say?  it's definitely an ale, not a lager (as it should be, no?)<br>
<br>
O:  lovely little hoppy beer, slightly soft mouthfeel but I could see some finding its velvety smoothness perfect; the grapefruit notes are spot on, and the light malt backbone is just enough to add a little sweetness<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,352 characters</span><br><br>","Aug 27, 2017",3.5,4,4,,4.5,4,Premo88

2.49,86328,"Reviewed from notes taken at the Dog and Duck in Austin, TX in 2014.<br>
<br>
On-draught.<br>
<br>
HEAD: ~1cm wide. White in colour. Supple. Decent thickness and creaminess. Above average (~3 minute) retention. Nice even lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head recedes.<br>
<br>
BODY: Translucent murky dark copper. Nontransparent. I see no yeast/lees within; it's a clean looking brew.<br>
<br>
Appears adequately carbonated.<br>
<br>
AROMA: Milky/whoppery malts, cream, pale English malts, butterscotch, floral and herbal hop notes, buttery toffee. No yeasty notes are detectable.<br>
<br>
Not boozy.<br>
<br>
A pleasant aroma of mild strength, though I do have concerns about potential diacetyl off-flavour based on the buttery notes so prominent in the aroma.<br>
<br>
TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Very buttery and milky, with a sickly English pale malt backbone corrupted by the buttery/butterscotch-redolent diacetyl that dominates the brew. Light floral and herbal hop character is in there too, along with some toffee. <br>
<br>
Has a light creamy feel on the palate. Medium-bodied. Has an okay thickness that doesn't really support the malt backbone all that well. Overcarbonated.<br>
<br>
Too sweet overall; definitely imbalanced even though the build boasts fair cohesion. The flavours showcased here just really don't appeal to me personally; maybe an English ale purist would find more value in this brew than I do.<br>
<br>
Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour. Not a complex, subtly executed, or nuanced brew by any stretch.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Not 512's strongest work. I don't care much for this one in particular, and wouldn't get it again. It'll be a chore to finish this.<br>

3.85,68870,"Bottle from the Whole Foods in Tanasbourne. As is wont with beers from here, their is no bottling date. Also, imo, this is closer in spirit and execution to a hoppy pale ale than an IPA and i'm reviewing it as such. <br>
<br>
Pouring a clear orange with a thin, white head that falls off to a disk leaving some lace, this looks nice. The nose is solid. Fruity and hoppy with a mild but bright citrus character along with a little floral character, this is refreshing. A mild honey and table sugar sweetness is also noticeable.<br>
<br>
The palate opens fruity and hoppy with a nice, easy going blend of citrus (oranges, a little grapefruit), a little melon and a mild floral character. Bitterness is low and clean, without any grassy flavors. The malt character is light, with a little biscuit and water cracker like doughy snappiness. It does, however, make the body pleasantly light but noticeable. Drying on the finish, this beer is light in body, crisply carbonated and refreshing with a lingering fruitiness.

Nose is quite grainy, but also with a big yeast punch. Fairly clean, sense of real light body character. Very faint light toasty grains and malt. Nothing that makes me get excited but nothing offensive either.<br>
<br>
A sweet malt richness hints on first sip, but then the palate weakens. Finish however brings some of the wet body a little better, as the grain malty action grows with some dry sweetness. Large on a barley drying angle.<br>

It is always fun when you discover a new style of bier. This one happens to be one of the rarest of them all. And this brewery claims some fame from it.<br>

It pours a beautiful color. Not the same as an oktoberfest but a very orangey brown with a nice off-white head that leaves some speckles of lacing.<br>
<br>
The smell is for sure maltier than a helles, but not as roasty as a dunkel. It shares a nuttiness with Oktoberfest but it isn't the same. It is more of a sweet fruit aroma as the yeast impacts this beer greater than an average lager.<br>

Smell is flowery and a little tart. It reminds me a little of a Flemish Ale sourness. Lactic acid? Not sure, but it smells odd. Also a decoction, Maillard kind of maltiness.<br>

Taste is little malty with decoction notes. A little nutty. The initial tartness is hidden away in the background. Like paterlodie says, this must be sauermalz. It certainly is not the infectious kind of tartness. The beer has been fermented pretty clean and besides the odd sourness this beer is a straight forward German beer.

<br>
Served from a cask into a nonic at Banger's in Austin, TX. Cost was $7.50 USD per 16 oz.<br>
<br>
6.8% ABV.<br>
<br>
HEAD: 1.5 fingers in height. Creamy, full, and thick, with a soft appearance and an even consistency. Supple. No lacing adheres to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. Retention is average (~2 minutes).<br>
<br>
BODY: Opaque dark black. No yeast/lees are visible within.<br>
<br>
Looks nice for a porter, but it doesn't have any unique or special characteristics. Appears undercarbonated (a seeming casualty of its unfortunate cask dispensing).<br>
<br>
I'm optimistic going in.<br>
<br>
AROMA: Muted dark malts, faint caramelized pecan, a faint kiss of fruit (I guess cherry), and buried roast.<br>
<br>
Nowhere near as evocative/expressive as it should be. Aromatic intensity is quite light.<br>
<br>
Again, this seems worse for having been cask-dispensed.<br>
<br>
TASTE: Dark malt sweetness, faint chocolate, a kiss of coconut, a bit of faint cherry and vague dark fruit. Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour.<br>
<br>
Has adequate complexity and subtlety, but this can't compete on those terms with the best expressions of the style.<br>
<br>
TEXTURE: Undercarbonated, thin, smooth, wet, unrefreshing. Suits the taste okay, but doesn't elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Downable, but not an improvement on 512's Pecan Porter or a better expression of a porter overall. I wouldn't buy it again, but it is above average (i.e. I'd take this over your run of the mill Sam Adams variety pack porter). Worse off for having been dispensed from a cask.<br>

Jammy Cabernet wine notes are evident, blending conspicuously into the flavour profile and partially eclipsing the delicate Belgian yeast flavour the beer features. Hints of pear. Belgian pale malt.<br>
<br>
ABV is well disguised, unlike many beers in the style.<br>
<br>
Very drinkable, showcasing Cabernet rather well, though I don't know that the base tripel is all that impressive itself. Still, I wouldn't have thought Cabernet would play so well in a tripel. Definitely a beer I'd buy by the sixer if offered at a $12-13 price.<br>

A black marshmallow of a beer. Interesting grainy but smooth taste. The malty sweetness is pleasant, more like a Hefeweizen without the esters.

<br>
Pours a very clear and light golden hue, with a touch of haze to it. In fact, it's pretty clear, but there's a translucent wuality to it, which means you can't actually see through it—just to the other side of the glass. Head is fine and white, leaving good, solid lace. Good looking brew overall.<br>
<br>
Nose is bright and peppery, with some savouriness notable in the pepper character; perhaps a hint of Sichuan to it. There's perhaps some citrus to it, but it's a spicy note, more like cloves than actual fruit. Very interesting and really quite pleasant.<br>
<br>
Soft entry, with very little malt character: instead the peppery hops take up the dominance of the palate, leaving some metallic sharpness and a hint of pith. Afterpalate broadens, giving some pleasant mild sweetness and a touch of body to the beer, while allowing the pepperiness to flow to all parts of the tongue. Nicely done.<br>
<br>
What is lacks in complexity, it really makes up for in drinkability. This is indeed a sessionable ale, and one that stays punchy, but light.

T:  Like the nose, this is very simple and to the point.  Baked bread, toasted malts mainly.  Again, finishes with a touch of earthy /grassy/spicy hops.  A bitterness builds a little as this warms.<br>

Hard to judge color due to opaque plastic mug, appears pink-orange, 1/2 finger white head small bubbles, some carbonation clinging to sides to plastic mug.

Poured into a nice tulip... The brew is glowing cloudy reddish pink... the head was fluffy with a pretty pink tinge... nice lacing.<br>

The nose is surprisingly subtle.. huge raspberry essence, but the lack of sweetness keeps things from ever verging on raspberry soda.<br>

Flavor is like a raspberry sock to the salivary glands... very tart with just a bit of lactic acidity... tons of fresh fruit with just enough residual sweetness to really deliver the fruit... nicely dry finish makes me want another glass.<br>

on tap @ Craft Pride, Austin, TX on 5 November 2015<br>
$5.50 / 6.5 oz.<br>
<br>
Notes: Listed at 8.2% ABV... not sure what year it is. The barrel actually brings out the pecan in comparison to the regular, unless of course there's actually double pecans in use - I tasted them side by side. Bourbon and oak are found in the aroma along with a mild dark roastiness. The flavor follows with an additional touch of fruit and chocolate and milky coffee; and then finishes with fruit, cocoa, a hint of alcohol (Bourbon) and coconut. Medium bodied with a median carbonation. It's unlike any beer I've ever tasted, and I've had other pecan beers before. Was it worth the cost? Probably when you consider that it's a beer you sip at rather than just drink down; and that there are added costs in the ingredients (mainly the pecans) to get it to where it is. In any case it's unique, and probably worth trying based on that alone, but I'd suggest you look for the standard version as well so that you can compare the two.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,065 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 20, 2017",4,4,4.25,,4,4.25,NeroFiddled

<br>
Pours a creamy pale khaki head atop an opaque black body. Head retention is poor; this dies within 30 seconds (if that).<br>
<br>
Aroma suggests a scintilla of burnt malt, some dark malt sweetness, floral hops, herbal hops, and evergreen hop aromatics. Pleasant and inviting, seemingly marrying dark malt sweetness and hop bitterness to good effect. Aromatic intensity is average.<br>
<br>
Tastes of evergreen/faint pine, floral hops, and subdued dark malt sweetness...I suspect the malt bill is mainly pale malt with dark malt or carafa in there more for colour than flavour... that's kind of cheating in terms of Cascadian dark ales. Hints of bready malt, ale yeast esters, and resin.<br>
<br>
Creamy, smooth, wet, medium to full-bodied. Well-carbonated.<br>
<br>
Depth of flavour is limited, as is hop pungency.<br>
<br>
A solid Cascadian dark ale if a subdued one; dial up the hop pungency, scale back the 2-row committing more to the carafa, and keep this level of balance and we'll have a real contender on our hands.<br>

<br>
A:  Pours a copper/amber/reddish color. A two finger white head forms with good retention initially, and a bit of spotty lace.<br>
S:  Big buttery aromas up front.  Some fruity esters linger.  Pears, apples, along with some light wood.  Not bad, the buttery notes through me off a bit.  Though I think that is from the wine barrel.  <br>
T:  Again, a substantial buttery character up front.  I am not that well verst in Cab, let alone wines in general.  Though, considering I have never encountered buttery diacetyl in regular 512 Tripel, I am thinking this comes from the wine barrel.  Fruity esters come next.  Pears and apples are apparent, along with a slight tartness and acidity.<br>
M/D:  A medium body that is effervescent and super crisp.  I love the carbonation here.  Appropriately weighty as well.  Easy to drink, even with the buttery character.  Something I can come back to with ease.<br>
<br>
I am almost positive the buttery character comes from the wine barrel.  It is not so much a detriment, just not what I was really expecting.  Though once I get use to it, the esters come out and are great.  I think the alcohol is well hidden as well.  Overall, very interesting, and something I will come back to.

T: The flavor was juicy tart citrus and tropical hops. Nice bitterness factor, citrusy-orange and tropical fruit converge in a well balance and equally defined fruitness that was well distinguished. Clean presentation, crisp ordeal and sweet malt bill.<br>

M:  Crisp mouthful, sharp bite, just how I like my hoppy beers with an active carbonation set against a medium malt bill. <br>

12oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry’s in Spokane for $1.59. No freshness date was visible. This is the first beer I’ve ever had that was labeled as a wheat IPA.<br>
<br>
Poured a hazy golden amber color, with a big, creamy off-white head. Excellent head retention and lots of lace.<br>
<br>
The aroma was of piney hops. There was also an earthy malt aroma, no doubt from the wheat malt. While the smell was primarily hoppy, the maltiness was stronger than many IPAs.<br>
<br>
The taste was similar to the smell. Piney hop flavor stood out the most, but there was a big, earthy wheat malt backbone.<br>
<br>
Medium bodied, with good carbonation. The mouthfeel was somewhat oily.<br>
<br>
I wouldn’t recommend this beer to an extreme hophead looking for a fix, but there was lots of tasty flavor in this beer. I could stick to it for a night’s quaffing with no complaints.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">850 characters</span><br><br>","Apr 14, 2014",4,4.25,4,-0.3%,3.75,4,woemad

<br>
A: Dark brown, nearly black color. Clarity is moderate. Head  poured huge (4 fingers) cola looking with lots of mixed sized tan bubbles. three pours before I could fit the beer in the glass.<br>
<br>
S: Moderate brett aromatics - Rustic barnyard, wet hay, and basement come to mind. No hop aroma. Mild toast and nutty malt aroma.<br>
<br>
T: Medium biscuit, toast and nutty malt flavor with low hop bitterness. Very rustic, earthy, dirt forward brett fermentation character which dominates the balance. Slight oak comes through as it warms up.  Light tartness. Rough around the edges mineral flavor in  the finish.<br>
<br>
M: Medium body with very high carbonation. Mild alcohol warming with no creaminess. Medium drying affect on the palette - slightly harsh.<br>
<br>
O:  Some major flaws with this beer. Carbonation was so high it was almost undrinkable. The harsher brett characteristics made the aroma and flavor unappealing.

Man, Goose Island has me programmed or somethin', 'cause I kept referring to this as ""312 DIPA"" all night... Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear sunset amber topped by a finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises bright melon, grapefruit zest, sweet caramel, light honey, and a twinge of pine resin. The taste brings in more of the same, with some fruit rinds tossed in, the pine taking on a more needle-y character, and the caramel drying out a bit, though still retaining its decent amount of sweetness. A vein of alcohol is perceptible, but it maintains its furtive personality. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying-ish finish.

Nose is very soft and light with muted dark chocolate, stronger hints of dark coffee, and some black raisin notes with a hint of licorice sliding in the back.  Flavors surpass the nose with deeply roasted malts, medium coffee flavors, and some moderately dark cocoa flavors coming in on the back with a hint of licorice.  All flavors are soft and delicate for the style which is aided by the soft light Belgian yeast note that gives the mouth feel a nice creamy lift adding to the smoothness factor.  The ale ends a with a lightly bitter, lingering, roasted malt note that is pleasing to most stout drinkers.  A most excellent brew.  Light for the American tastes, but excellent for a unique hybrid.<br>

S- Faint whiff of floral and citrus hops. Grapefruit is dominant fruity odor. <br>

<br>
A - Poured a muddy brown with no visible carbonation and a nice filmy retention. Two finger beige head. Kinda mysterious and inviting.<br>

S - Spicy with dark fruits, plums and a slight booze note. Quite nice.<br>

T - Lot's of dark fruit, spice is mild but there in a complimentary way. Really rich, boozy fruits.<br>

M - Mild carbonation and a full body with a dry finish.<br>

<br>
Bought a single because I thought I had remembered this brewery was well thought of and had never seen it in my area before.  Bottled 12/16/16, which I did not notice until now.  At this age I would not expect a whole lot.<br>
<br>
Poured from the 12 oz,. bottle into a Lawson's stemmed tulip.<br>
<br>
a: Translucent orange with an inch thick white head which receded to thick even surface foam and dense lacing.<br>
<br>
s: Fruit cup with some strength.<br>
<br>
t: More pine than fruit, moderate hop bite draws attention over the malt and dry finish.<br>
<br>
m: Medium plus, very good body and carbonation tingle.<br>
<br>
o: Advertised as a NW coast IPA, not sure how that differs from your average west coast style but this one has more fruitiness with the pine.  A solid IPA on the higher end of the spectrum, just short of a double, and to my thinking better than the total rating it has here.

Poors in fine with average head and nice brown color with orange shine in it and totaly clear. Nose is strange; sweet, grainy, and creamy nose. Grassy, sour and a smell I recal from germinating malts( Sauermalt?). Anyway something else as the regular and a nice one for a change!<br>
Taste is strange too; very malty and sweet, little ironlike, little sour and caramellic. Takes a long time before aftertaste starts and is only litle bitter. Mouthfeel is eating and drinking at the same time plus all tasting pupils lighting up so as complex as can be but good.<br>
Drinkability is good; loved to drink this one but it's strageness makes it only enjoyable every now and then.

Smell - Citrusy aroma with light pine and a touch of bread and caramel.<br>

Taste - Follows the nose. Citrus hops with lesser notes of pine. Malts are distant, but hints of roast and chocolate do peak through briefly. <br>

A few chunks of sediment sink into the glass of the beer. The nose....it's like a touch of bland sourness with pinches of dark malt and fudge. <br>
<br>
A little sour and a little sweet. Flanders Brown knnockoff? There is an essence of toffee and strawberry, only to be knocked off by a mild, bland sourness. Its body is nearly medium sized, and rather smooth with the carbonation. <br>

3.35,75401,"Foeder II: Brewed Apr 2013 / Bottled Feb 2015. Served cold into a goblet and allowed to warm over the course of consumption.<br>
<br>
Truncated notes below:<br>
<br>
HEAD: Full and luscious, with good thickness and a nice even consistency. Good complexion. Creamy and frothy. Retention is average; this lasts for only 2 minutes. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. ~1 inch wide.<br>
<br>
BODY: Oddly, it's an opaque solid black. Not an ink black or jet black, but rather dark. I see no yeast or hop sediment.<br>
<br>
It's strangely dark for a sour, but the head is promising. Appears adequately carbonated.<br>
<br>
AROMA: Has plenty of wild ale characteristics, with wild ale yeasts, an eclectic sourness which isn't limited to the usual lactobacillus - but rather showcases pediococcus shockingly well, faint oak barrel, and hints of muted cherry fruit. It does suffer a bit from a minor dampened cardboard note - giving it a musty and surprisingly dry aroma, but overall the pediococcus alone has me interested in this beer. It's more tart than sour, and it isn't even that tart; you'd think they'd commit more to that given the cherry note. In any case, I'd guess the sourness is around a 3/10 in terms of intensity just from the aroma.<br>
<br>
Aromatic intensity is average.<br>
<br>
TASTE: Pediococcus bacteria is in control here, giving it a mild sourness (~2/10 in terms of intensity) which sour fans will find wanting. Its 9% ABV is shockingly well concealed. The cherry is muted to its detriment, and it lacks sufficient tartness. Slightly acetic, though more of an acetic pie crust character on par with Rodenbach would do wonders. I find no brettanomyces funkiness. I'm doubting lactobacillus was used, but such usage would definitely improve this beer - both by giving it more sourness and by lending the mouthfeel a needed acidic smackiness.<br>
<br>
The barrel is in the background, but it doesn't really integrate well into the base. The abovementioned dampened cardboard note does make an appearance - a byproduct of oversoaked oak wood. But the oak itself lends nothing to improve the beer aside from a weak generic musty wood note that I suppose lends the build some cohesion.<br>
<br>
Not tart or sour enough to appease the discerning sour drinker, but the pediococcus is nice. Compared to the best beers in the style, it's rather shallow and simple, with a subpar balance. I do like it in a general sense, but it leaves much to be desired.<br>
<br>
TEXTURE: Slightly acetic and definitely of above average acidity. Unrefreshing, medium-bodied, oddly dry and musty, and smooth. A sharper tangier more acidic feel would help complement the sour notes nicely, and a more smacky texture would help play up the pucker factor.<br>
<br>
There's no harmony of texture to taste, but this isn't badly executed by any stretch. A bit overcarbonated, sure, but overall it does an okay job complementing the taste.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Not a bad first foray into wild fermentation, but way off the mark if 512 is hoping to compete with Jester King or even Real Ale in the Austin, TX market. I'll have no trouble finishing the entire 750ml bottle by myself, and I imagine that imperceptible 9% ABV will catch up to me. I wouldn't buy this again, especially at its extortionate price relative to its (lack of) quality, but it shows definite promise in terms of what we can expect from 512's wild/sour efforts in the future. I do have to ask - why weren't the brettanomyces yeast and pediococcus bacteria added during primary fermentation, instead of after?<br>

2.62,33518,"Awesome label. Mine was stuck upside-down as well, which I feel adds some character.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this absolutely gushes on uncapping. Obscenely overcarbonated, I'm left with about a third of a bottle once it has settled enough to do a pour. Pale brownish in colour, with an ironically minimal head after the gushing carbonation has worn itself out. Light-bodied with a fair amount of cloudy sedimentation. Eh.<br>
<br>
Nose is mild, with a slight Belgian-yeast roundness to it, and a touch of cinnamon spice. It also has the slight twang of acidity, and a thin watery character that gives the faint suggestion of pretty generic homebrew.<br>
<br>
Taste is battered by the carbonation, which is still present with a vengeance. Bubbling through the palate, I'm left with strained taste buds by the time the flavours actually come through. There's actually a pleasant roasty bitterness to this which comes through late and adds a touch of sophistication. But this sits above that insane seltzer water character and the thin spicy character from the yeast. There's little else to recommend it.<br>
<br>
Wow. I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this. Any Belgian should be better than this: you guys have such a long and wonderful brewing tradition to draw upon.

3.59,65536,"I had this on-tap recently and adored it, so I jumped at the chance to nab a 64 oz growler fill today. Reviewed live as a milk stout.<br>
<br>
Served chilled into a pilsner glass in Austin, TX, and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Expectations are high. The weight and angle of the growler necessitated an unusually vigorous pour.<br>
<br>
No bubble show forms as it's poured.<br>
<br>
HEAD: 4 fingers wide. Gorgeous tan colour, great creaminess. Full, thick, and supple, with a soft overall appearance and an even consistency. Leaves a webby coating of lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes. Retention is excellent - easily 10 minutes. This is damned impressive.<br>
<br>
BODY: As you'd expect, it's an opaque solid jet black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.<br>
<br>
Overall, it's a great looking milk stout. There are of course ways it could be improved - a darker richer head, a bubble show, a better complexion - but that's nitpicking.<br>
<br>
AROMA: The subtle ancho chile characteristics are fantastic, and the chile is just as present as it should be. The lactose sugar, dark malt, and chocolate malt-induced sweetness isn't too overt; in fact, this may be one of the more restrained milk stout aromas I've ever encountered. The roasted barley is nowhere near as prominent as it ought to be.<br>
<br>
Overall, the aroma promises a balanced no-frills milk stout with some interesting chile character. Aromatic intensity is mild at most.<br>
<br>
No off-notes, hop character, or yeast character is detectable. This is certainly to style.<br>
<br>
TASTE: Not quite as good as I remember it being on-draught.<br>
<br>
The chile heat in the third act is the first element I notice, but it's present from the early second act - it's just so subtly executed. It does grow on you and intensify as the beer comes to temperature, which I love. The chile heat isn't bad by any means - on par with mild ancho. I can't see anyone needing a second beverage whilst drinking this.<br>
<br>
Predictably, dark/schwarz malts, chocolate malts, and lactose sugar fill out the malt backbone and lend it sweetness, but this isn't anywhere near as sweet as I expected, and is certainly on the tamer side for the style. Added complexity comes from cream, a hint of marshmallow, and a touch of roast. I crave more roasted barley, and constructively this build could do with still more intricacy - why not coffee, hazelnut, caramelized pecan, actual chocolate, cocoa nibs, vanilla bean, etc. It's adequately complex, but there's room for more.<br>
<br>
The blend of admittedly basic dark malt sweetness with the subtle chile is just damned effective. There's an elegance to this beer's straightforward quality and balance.<br>
<br>
The flavour duration is long, largely as result of the subtle chile heat that lingers into the aftertaste, encouraging another sip. Flavour depth and intensity are average or above average. This is absolutely a cohesive brew, and I do find that it tastes like a gestalt whole; it's hard to imagine removing anything. And the chile doesn't feel forced into the otherwise standard milk stout build at all.<br>
<br>
I'm really enjoying this one, but my biggest issue is with the light vinegar that accompanies the chile - though I don't remember this characteristic from the draught version.<br>
<br>
TEXTURE: Smooth, creamy, wet, and medium-bodied, with modest thickness. It's not a syrupy, sticky, or viscous mess like it could be. It's unrefreshing, but then no good milk stout isn't. Well-carbonated. Has adequate weight and heft on the palate, but it's not boozy. The alcohol is well-disguised.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Easily the most memorable milk stout I've had this year so far, and frankly I doubt I'll see it beaten. For my money, this crushes market imposters from other states like Left Hand's Milk Stout or Odell's Lugene's, but I'm not sure whether I prefer this or Lakewood's The Temptress in the Texan market. In any case, it's high praise when a milk stout is mentioned in the same vein as those other quality offerings, and I'll definitely plan on having this again. This growler fill has numbered days, gentlemen. This is worth seeking out when in Texas, and manages to attain a high drinkability even with the presence of chile heat - which is very tough to do. This is absolutely one of 512's best beers.<br>
<br>

<br>
***<br>
02.05.15: 2nd impressions from the same growler:<br>
<br>
The chile is muted when this is served cold, and the sweetness takes over to its detriment. Needs time to warm.<br>
<br>
Though it has (already) deteriorated somewhat in the growler, it remains a tasty brew with subtle chili heat and aptly high sweetness. Roasted barley presence would be nice, but overall it's pretty well balanced for what it is and I definitely like it.<br>
<br>
Its high sweetness does limit its drinkability, but it's easily one of the best milk stouts available in Texas and in the USA (based on what I've had). Well worth trying.<br>

2.86,95371,"512 Brewing – “Double IPA”<br>
<br>
08.28.13<br>
<br>
32oz grumbler filled (via tube connected to tap) at The Growler Room in Austin, Texas, a couple days ago, and refrigerated since it was purchased. 512 brewing “Double IPA.” Served into a Spaten stange glass in me gaff in low altitude Austin, Texas. Expectations are average; I haven’t loved anything from this brewery yet. <br>
<br>
I can’t confirm the ABV; The Growler Room didn’t specify one and 512’s website has no information on this beer currently. <br>
<br>
Served cold – straight from me fridge. Side-poured with extra vigor as slight carbonation issues are anticipated given the growler serving type. <br>
<br>
A: No bubble show as I pour. <br>
<br>
Pours a four finger wide head of the standard white-khaki colour typical of heads in the imperial IPA style. It’s got a good fluffy soft complexion and appears somewhat creamy and frothy. Has a good thicknss to it. Light inconsistent lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head slowly recedes. Head retention is quite good – about 7+ minutes. <br>
<br>
I’m pleased with the head overall. <br>
<br>
Body colour is a hazy murky dark copper; it’s lacking vibrance – much to my disappointment. Semitransparent, semitranslucent. No yeast particles are visible. <br>
<br>
It could certainly be more lively and inviting; it’s a bit reticent for the style and isn’t consistent with the appearances of the best imperial IPAs I’ve had. Still, I’m optimistic and excited to try it. The head is fairly impressive considering this is a growler pour. <br>
<br>
Sm: Unquestionably hop-emphatic, the aroma suggests primarily floral hop character with a bit of pine as well, but suffers from an off-putting sweet candy floss/cotton candy note that has me concerned about the beer’s sweetness. Quite fragrant and grassy, with evergreen and pine notes lending a crisp refreshing quality to the aroma. <br>
<br>
On the malty side, it’s pretty standard – just your run-of-the-mill malting with pale malts. Perhaps a dash of munich or pils malts, but no biscuit or cereals or anything like that. <br>
<br>
The hop choices aren’t horribly impressive, and there isn’t any obvious marriage of hops to malts. There’s nothing unique or special here.<br>
<br>
No yeast character or alcohol is detectable. Aroma is of mild strength overall. <br>
<br>
T: A bit of badly executed citrus in the latter half of the second act and about the climax is the first thing I pick up on; I get rough grapefruit with accompanying untamed bitterness and some off-putting tree-like notes of pine and evergreen that don’t do this beer any favors. Standard pale malts comprise the simple basic foundation. The candi character from the aroma is also featured in the flavour profile to its detriment. Some honey bolsters the sweetness still further, throwing the beer further out of balance. Bitterness is noticeable – something of a feat considering the beer is somehow also too sweet at other points in its structure. Generic floral hop character is predictably present throughout. <br>
<br>
No yeast character comes through, and I do pick up on a bit of alcohol warmth. <br>
<br>
Overall, it’s not great for an imperial IPA. The lack of balance in particular is the core flaw with this beer. The choices of hops are poor in my opinion and don’t represent a cohesive focused direction of flavour; there’s little intentionality and deliberation behind the ingredients selected – and this has an obvious effect on the flavour profile. Not a gestalt beer by any means. <br>
<br>
Depth of flavour is disappointingly shallow. Intensity and duration of flavour are average. <br>
<br>
Mf: Quite typical. Overcarbonated – a surprise from a growler. Smooth and wet. Okay body. Decent presence on the palate. It suits the flavour profile only decently, and never feels custom-tailored to it. Not oily, harsh, gushed, or hot, but there is some light warmth from the alcohol. A bit too thick for the lack of flavour depth and diversity, but not quite overbearing. Certainly not as soft or pleasant as it should be. <br>
<br>
Dr: I appreciate that the contemporary beer marketplace seems to demand that a brewery offer an imperial IPA, but 512 has provided a subpar effort with this beer. I wouldn’t recommend it to friends, nor would I get it again, and while I’ll finish my grumbler, I won’t enjoy it as I hoped I would. I’m glad I didn’t get a full growler. It’s downable and inoffensive, but it won’t impress. Nice try, 512, but this is a swing and a miss. <br>
<br>
A forgettable imperial IPA that will get lost amidst the myriad of better (and often more affordable) beers in the style. I continue to be unimpressed by 512’s efforts. <br>

Taste is upfront liquorice and flowery with roses and a light roasted taste, which is actually quite mild. The yeast adds a Belgian character, which makes the beer fruity and different.

T: Notes of coffee, roasted grain, heavy cream, bitter chocolate, and grassy hops wash across the palate. The finish is delicate and smooth with roasted grain and bitter chocolate notes. <br>
<br>
M: A little thin and light bodied for the style. To me, this comes across as neither a Belgian stout nor a true Belgian dark ale. It sits uncomfortably in between these two styles. I also find this beer to be a bit watery, at least when served on-tap.<br>
<br>
O: This ale does nothing for me. Is it a stout? Is it a dark ale? I'm neither a huge fan of Belgian stouts nor the toastier, grainier dark ales, and this one comes across as being an utter mess. The only thing I can really compare it to is Brasserie Dupont's Monk's Stout, which I loathed. Thankfully, I don't find this beer to be as bad as that one, and while I cannot recommend this one to anyone, I can't wholeheartedly write it off either.

Appearance - Slow gusher when opened. Color is murky orange/brown with some settled flecks and an off-white head. A thick ring and spotty cap along with bits of lace are left by the end.<br>
<br>
Smell - All signs point to this beer being a bit odd. Sweet tea, bubblegum, sweet tarts, lotion, cinnamon, scented soap, peppery lemonade? Outdoorsy leafy feel but not particularly flowery. Strange but certainly unique, I don't understand it, but gotta say I dig it.<br>
<br>
Taste - More tartness here, really quite different from the smell, but probably just as strange. Lightly sour, lactic tones, spiced caramel apple, pear, candy sweetness, ginger ale, kind of a flanders and white wine feel to it. Some light earthy tones. Flowery kind of in an air freshener way. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - Decent with pleasant carbonation. No noticeable alcohol, drinkability suppressed a bit from overall weirdness.<br>
<br>
Overall - Pretty much sketchy and all over the place, what with the awful label/gushing/thick flecks/wtf flavor, not bad though, questionable yet somewhat pleasant and intriguing.

<br>
A-A normal pour produces about a finger of white foam. The retention is OK and the head leaves a little bit of fine lacing on the glass as I drink. The beer beneath the head is an unattractive yellow with a bit of haze to it. Some champagne-like carbonation is visible.<br>
<br>
S-The aroma is heavy on the cucumber, which has a seriously sweet flavor to it; almost like candy. I also sniff some lemon and lime tartness and just a hint of light funk that reminds me of cheese. Weird stuff, but not awful.<br>
<br>
T-The taste is also heavy on the cucumber. It is a bit fake tasting with a lot of candy-like sweetness to go with the cucumber flavors. The lemon-lime flavors remind me of Sprite or 7-Up and the only flavor that is close to normal beer is the mild lactic acidity that fades to a grainy finish. <br>
<br>
M-The beer is light and effervescent on the palate. Carbonation is fine and bubbly. Like soda.<br>
<br>
O-The can says this beer is trying to introduce people to sours and ride the wave of popularity for sour beers, but this stuff hardly tastes like beer. Nevertheless, if it weren't so sweet, it would be pretty refreshing and the light body does, indeed, make it crushable.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,198 characters</span><br><br>","May 04, 2017",4,3.5,3.5,-8.8%,3.75,3.5,spoony

<br>
A: Pours a hazy, dark golden color with some floating particulates. It has a big, rocky, white head that stays at about one finger for the entire drink. <br>
<br>
S: The aroma is pretty sweet of the bat. As it lingers, belgian yeast and various spices can be picked up. It has a distinct peppery aspect as well as notes of sour apple.<br>
<br>
T: The taste is definitely more muted than the aroma. I pick up on more of the yeast, spices and sour apples than the sweetness, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, all flavors are mellow to a fault.<br>
<br>
M: Medium bodied with an adequate amount of carbonation. There is a distinct crispness in the finish that provides a refreshing palate cleanser.<br>
<br>
O: I picked this up, along with a few others from this brewery, because of the label art (apparently the new labels are different than what is pictured here and are way more epic). It was an enjoyable tripel, but certainly not the best. I'd say it's slightly above average at best.

Appearance: Black with an off white cap of head. It sticks around through out the glass, the lacing sticks around as well.<br>

Smell: A touch of roast and some cocoa, but mostly I get fruity yeast. I wonder what strain they use. Seriously, the nose is almost tropical fruity. <br>

Taste: The taste is a mild overall flavor. The darkness of the beer does not translate to the taste, in the way one might expect. No roast or stout flavors. Smooth easy drinking with a medicinal or minty even aftertaste.<br>

Hell, I am a media whore, giving interviews &amp; having my picture taken at a rate that rivals the Kardashians &amp; I would love for the cash register to begin pinging in my favor. Get over it.

<br>
I am coming to embrace the Pop! of the cap since a favorite Countian of mine takes them to do all sorts of arts &amp; crafts things, including the creation of a cap-mail vest! Once completed, I went with a gentle pour IAW my New Year's resolution. An in-glass swirl raised two-plus fingers of foamy, rocky, tawny head with modest retention. Color was a pretty Golden-Amber (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7) with NE-quality clarity, enticing a visit from The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas &amp; Croesus, enabling their passion. The nose held a biscuity maltiness that offset the strong grapefruit aromas from the hops &amp; I was intrigued. Mouthfeel was medium, right in Baby Bear's wheelhouse of just right. The taste was bitter &amp; citrusy, especially with grapefruit, but it was not as aggressive as some that I have encountered of late. Instead, it was offset by a dry, biscuity maltiness that was also just right. It seemed to me like an early AIPA that bridges the gap between EIPAs &amp; more current versions of AIPAs that push up against DIPAs. Phew! Follow me? It was hoppy without being super hoppy, but enough that the malt was secondary. Finish was dry, but not astoundingly bitter.

S:  The nose is great.  Musty yeast, tart fruits of cherries, grapes, and apples.  Even some citrusy orange rind.  This all intermingles with some light tannins and oak.  The Brett yeast, bacteria and wood all work really well here.<br>
T:  The oak tannins are a bit more prevalent and up front than the nose.  Up front is a litle sweet as well, but that fades as this warms and everything else takes over.  Less of that musty basement character that I love, but still present and builds as this warms.  Lightly tart fruits that follow the nose.  It just doesn't hit all the right notes perfectly like the nose.  Still very good anyway.<br>
M/O:  A light to medium body.  Incredibly effervescent and spritzy.  Tannins all over the place, which I really like.  Very enjoyable and easy to drink.  The 750ml will be gone in no time.  <br>
<br>
I have typically found 512's sour or wild ales a bit one noted and not particularly interesting.  This is really well done though.  With two years in a wine barrel, this gets a little tannin heavy, but it does work with the yeast and bacteria.

I is a amber-brown color and it has a sweet prune-brandy type flavor with some vanilla overtones. The smell is candy fruit-plum. <br>

The taste follows the nose and is quite delicious. Bitter dark chocolate and sweet toffee coat the tongue initially. No indication of dark fruit like is slightly present in the nose, which is unfortunate. The taste is overall not as pleasant as the aroma. Really can't decipher that it is a Belgian Stout over your average American or English stout.<br>
This beer is adequately carbonated for a Belgian stout and although the mouthfeel could be fuller, it shouldn't be held against this beer as it is only 5.5% ABV.<br>

The beer pours a peachy orange color with good head and considerable sticky lacing. The nose is impressive as well, as I pick up considerable tropical fruit, citrus and pine. The beer just smells very juicy. On the palate, this beer is every bit as impressive, with the flavor profile replicating the nose very closely. The finish long and bitter, with the moderate tropical sweetness nicely countered and balanced by the the level of hoppy bitterness once gets in this beer. Mouthfeel is meidum bodied to full, with a long, pleasantly bitter finish. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and so drinkability is quite good. <br>

3.47,45498,"As Wildfire Brewing soon changes its name to 10 Barrel Brewing, some beers with fire-themed names such as this will be renamed. I don't know what this one will end up as, but I have it on good authority that the recipes will remain unaltered. <br>
<br>
In most cases that would be a good idea. But Backdraft was the least drinkable of the four Wildfire beers I had on a recent jaunt to Bend. It begins well enough with a mind-blowing hop aroma. Usually there's something lost between the hop cones or pellets you hold in your hand before brewing, and the perceived taste or smell that ends up in the beer. But in this beer, nothing is lost. The taste and the smell are as immediate and fresh as in any beer I've ever had. <br>
<br>
Moreover, the sensory spectrum between taste and smell is wonderfully obscured here. The smell falls neatly into the taste and vice versa, as if you were tasting the smell or smelling the taste. I suppose at some physiological level you actually are, but it is uncommonly expressed here with a resinous potency of floral, spicy hops. <br>
	<br>
My main critique of this ale would be that it's actually too hoppy. That's right, too many hops. There's no balance to latch onto and the flavor is unrelenting. If hops were expressed in terms of electric currency, this beer would be like sitting in an electric chair. It just zaps the senses with high voltage hops beyond the point of comfortable consumption. Drink it as an ""extreme"" beer if you like, but don't count on subtlety. <br>
	<br>
At least you can tell Backdraft is brewed with pellets, because the leaf material of whole cone hops would have corrupted the mouthfeel at this level of hoppiness. The lack of intrusive tannic astringency with this much hop flavor could only be gained from the utilization advantage derived from hop pellets. <br>
	<br>
The rest of this ale may be described as deep amber with enough crimson blush to pass for a red ale. It has no lace and a rimmed head. <br>
	<br>
Based strictly on my own preferences, I'm grading this one at mid-range. But if you need a hardcore hop fix and you have no further use for your taste buds for the evening, this one will do.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">2,129 characters</span><br><br>","Oct 21, 2008",3.5,4,3,-5.4%,4.5,3,RedDiamond

Pour into a shapely snifter, this one is the hue of an apricot soda; light, rust-orange, a little cloudy, and completely headless. If they made an apricot-flavored sour patch kid candy, it would smell just like this. The aroma is quite fruity and only a bit of yeasty funk comes through. On the taste buds, however, the wild sour and apricot sweetness fight for palate-share. This is distinct from a fruit-funk tango in which the flavors compliment and balance each other like a Chinese sweet and sour sauce. Instead, the competing tastes stand at odds, creating something that falls short of a solid fruity farmhouse ale. <br>
<br>
Moreover, the sour esters and apricot additions stand strong enough to render the biscuity malts and lightly citric hops not just an afterthought, but nearly unnoticeable. The mouthfeel is somewhat light and just a tiny bit syrupy, with plenty of carbonation. This one is worth trying one time but not two for me. I'll stick with more traditional Saisons and French Bieres de Garde for my sour ale fix.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,056 characters</span><br><br>","Apr 01, 2013",3,3.5,2.75,-21.9%,3.5,3,sam_bliss

3.1,33506,"Roasted walnut with sepia colored highlights. Golden brown sugar colored foam can be seen atop the beer... and erupting out the top of the bottle in an unrelenting, lava-like flow. The rifle crack on swing-top release should have been my first clue. All things considered, the beer looks pretty good, especially on the second pour.<br>
<br>
The nose is nothing special. It isn't black or chocolate malty enough to belong to a stout and it isn't complex enough to belong to a Belgian dark ale. Incidently, 't Hofbrouwerijke calls this brew a Belgian stout (which really should be a style on this site). With respect to specifics... dark caramel and dark fruit.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's the obviously faulty carbonation, but this isn't the best dark ale/stout that I've ever tasted. It doesn't have much flavor intensity and it's significantly short on complexity as well. It doesn't even taste like Belgian yeast was used, which would be an odd design choice if true.<br>
<br>
There isn't much malt present, even for a 5.5% ale. Flavors include watery chocolate, dark caramel and a small splash of cold coffee. Maybe a hint of anise, but it's in the background. It doesn't help matters that nothing is in the foreground. Spicy yeast esters are essentially AWOL.<br>
<br>
The mouthfeel is thinner than thin and is woefully underbubbled. I'm sure it was all kinds of fizzy to start, but I was busy running to the kitchen for paper towels and then cleaning up my desktop. Hopefully, your bottle will be properly carbonated.<br>
<br>
It's a damn shame that this bottle of Hofblues is not as the brewers intended it to be. For that reason, I can't recommend it and I can't *not* recommend it. This is probably pretty decent beer in its ideal state, so take that for whatever it's worth.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,735 characters</span><br><br>","Mar 30, 2009",2.5,3.5,3,-14.8%,3.5,3,BuckeyeNation

Smell - Sweet, with notes of molasses, cola, and a hint of raisins. <br>
<br>
Taste - Not quite as sweet as the nose led on. Hits first on some toasted malt character. Faint raisin and caramel. Strong earthy and grassy hops hit mid-taste and deliver a strong, woody, slightly burnt bitterness that rides well into the aftertaste with touches of alcohol astringency. <br>

<br>
Pours a murky brown with a half-finger white head that quickly subsides to a tight ring around the glass. Awesome label.<br>
<br>
Aroma is great - cherries, oak and a pleasant tartness, maybe balsamic. Almost reminds of an oud bruin and set the bar very high.<br>
<br>
Relative to the aroma, the taste is a disappointment. Absolutely though, the taste is pretty good. A somewhat-shocking lack of tartness/acidity, but still pleasant. Leather is present in the taste but not noticed in aroma, a bit of fruit in the finish, and more malt body than I was expecting. Very soft lactic (spit-thickening?) feel, carbonation is just right. <br>
<br>
Overall a good beer, although the taste/aroma disagreement re: acidity/tartness was kind of a surprise. I would have preferred it to be more sour, but that may develop over time. Great effort from (512) - strongly suggest seeking this out if you are able.<br>
<br>
Edit: had a third bottle recently, and this beer is starting to come into its own. Really didn't know what to expect after the first bottle a long time ago, but happy to see that a truly solid sour brown has developed.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,179 characters</span><br><br>","Feb 21, 2013",4.5,4,4.5,,4.5,4.5,drummermattie02

3.02,45496,"Appearance- Pours up a fair amount of head which has some retention that seems to increase as time passes. Lacing is spotty at the moment. The head is beige color while the body is a dark chestnut brown which shows patches of maroon when held up to the light. Almost a black ale but not quite. <br>
<br>
Nose- Fairly subdued. Caramel has some presence from the bottle but is much weaker from the glass. There are some roasted malts, weak coffee, and a touch of smoke. After some swirling, the glass displays a bubblegum note that is quickly replaced by the roasted scents. <br>
<br>
Taste- Roasted malts and weak coffee are the first aspects I note and honestly, that's about it. There's some light citrus but not much else. This has a very dull flavor profile. The 10 Barrel website says this has 38 IBUs but I get nothing close to that “much” bitterness. Every aspect of the palate is weak and the best thing I can say about this beer is that there are no off flavors. It certainly has nothing in common with beers I've had in the style and would be better regarded as a Euro Dark Lager. Some of the bubblegum I detected on the nose is showing itself. At best, this is an average beer. After a few minutes, some more coffee and bitterness is showing itself but not enough to become more than mediocre. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel- Between light and medium bodied. Maybe a little too much carbonation. Hints of smoothness and creaminess. <br>
<br>
Drinkability- Very easygoing. No off flavors and no dominant aspects and no heat make it very sessionable. Not too bad of a price- around $3.50 a bomber. <br>
<br>
Overall- Mediocre beer. If you like black lagers, this is worth a try. If you want a real black ale (a black IPA or a CDA), then you should ignore this.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,721 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 25, 2013",3.5,2.5,3,-17.3%,3,3,artoolemomo

<br>
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.<br>
<br>
Pours a 1.5 finger wide head of tan colour. Good cream and thickness. Poor (&amp;lt;20 second) retention. Uneven lacing sticks to the sides of the glass.<br>
<br>
Body colour is a predictable opaque black. No floating yeast particles/sediment is visible.<br>
<br>
Not a unique or special appearance for an imperial stout, but there are no overt flaws. It's about what you'd expect given the style, and I think it looks pretty good.<br>
<br>
Sm: Chocolate malt, dark malts, vanilla. Hints of subtle bourbon. No hop profile, alcohol, or yeast character is detectable. A hint of roast. I'm not picking up any coffee or true milk chocolate. It's an appealing aroma, if a subdued one. Light in strength. I'm looking forward to trying it. <br>
<br>
T/Mf: Has some nice milk chocolate notes; very soft. Smooth and wet. Good thickness and body. It's not syrupy like many bad imperial stouts. Has a good presence on the palate. Well-carbonated.<br>
<br>
No hop profile, yeast character, or alcohol comes through. <br>
<br>
Dark malts. Chocolate malt. Cream. Sadly, it's a been lacking in terms of roast. It's a pretty simple build for an imperial stout, but it does have some limited subtlety, and the buried vanilla notes are a nice touch. I do like it, but you have to bring far more to the table to compete with the greats in this style. It's lacking a unique or special element. Everything this beer does, another beer in the style does better. <br>
<br>
Dr: A likable plain ole imperial stout with no frills. Sort of the RyanAir of imperial stouts, if you will. I'd get it again and it's quite drinkable, but it just can't compete with the world-class beers in the style. It's one of the better Texan beers I've had in my short time here. I might recommend it to friends. Hides its ABV well. Give it a go if you chance across it.<br>

3.53,28810,"Hazy pumpkin with all sorts of fine flecks and larger flakes. It's unusual to get this many particulates on the first pour from a 750 ml bottle. The bubbly head is midway between ivory and ecru. It doesn't have a Belgianesque texture and it isn't an outstanding lace creator, but it gets the job done. Second and third pours improve the appearance just enough for the next highest score to be awarded.<br>
<br>
Although it doesn't smell classically tripel-like, the beer smells more like a Belgian tripel than any other style. It's golden malty and herbal hoppy, with a hint of orchard fruit and very little spice. Might my taste buds be more impressed? Doubtful.<br>
<br>
Bosprotter is a decent tripel, no more than that. First, toasted malt or light caramel notes should not be present in beer of this style. Second, there's too much bitterness (without corresponding good hop flavor) and not enough sweetness. On a positive note, there's plenty of bold flavor. On a negative note, it isn't very complex or very deep.<br>
<br>
Flavors include well-toasted white bread, pears and apples, steely caramel, woodsy herbs, white pepper and ground clove. It tastes like the yeast gobbled up the vast majority of the sugars, which leads to a borderline arid finish. This isn't bad beer by any means, but calling it good beer would be a stretch.<br>
<br>
The mouthfeel isn't full enough or smooth enough due to a lack of quality bubbles. Given my experience with Hofblues, I should probably be thankful that the carbonation is within the range of acceptable.<br>
<br>
Bosprotter is an okay tripel in the end, but I wouldn't recommend spending $13.99 for a bottle like I did.

Hazy, unfiltered or cloudy would all be understatements about the clarity of this beer. It is down right murky, so much so that you can't see out the other side of the glass. With a nice thick band of head that dissipates quickly but leaves some clingy lacing.<br>
<br>
Smelling of fresh hay, apricot, and some bitter understated hops notes this is appealing but not wowing or even different from most of the style.<br>
<br>
This is full of flavor and has a really broad, long feel to it. With some initial acid this is refreshing but really this is a back loaded beer. Full of earthy, dry flavors of stone, banana chip, and dried apple, this is not nearly as ester-y as one would imagine a ""triple"" to be, again being in line with the Pale side of the spectrum. I love how this unfolds from front to back.<br>
<br>
The best part of this beer is how easy it can be drunk. A bottle goes down surprisingly fast. Be sure to pace yourself.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,054 characters</span><br><br>","Feb 12, 2009",4,4.5,4.5,,3.5,4.5,bryanbrick

Medium bodied with light carbonation and a light, but decent, acidic character. Not as sour as a ""sour fan"" would want but a very nice balanced brew.<br>

Bosprotter happened to be a slow gusher; I caught most of it but did happen to lose some foam. This tripel pours with a glowing apricot body. There's some hazy from all the commotion and a little yeast got forced into the glass. The head was clean white and billowy, growing to three fingers on the pour. The head fell rather slowly to a thick cap and left circular airy chunk lacing down the glass.<br>
<br>
Each swirl brings forward a torrent of juicy sweet aromas to the nose. Orchard fruits are front and center. Glistening ripe pear, green apples, and sweet ripe peaches all in that order from most to least. Bubblegum assaults the sense as well before an underlying layer of candi sugar comes forward. After all the freshness this beer trails off into a slight grassy and herbal hop character that really brings things together. There are even some banana-like esters popping up here and there.<br>
<br>
The flavor, while good, doesn't quite live up to the aroma. Each aspect of the smell is present but seems a little muddled compared to how they jump out in the smell. The orchard fruits hit upfront and slowly fade back letting the slightly herbal slightly grassy bitterness shine through. There seems to be a mineralish finish on this beer along with the mild bitterness. The flavors come together pretty well after a little breathing.<br>
<br>
When I first started drinking this beer I thought the body seemed too light and lifeless but as I drink it just keeps getting better. The body is light and shows a little stick on the swallow. The carbonation is a lot lower then I expected. With the instant gushing I figured this to be overly carbonated but it's not at all prickly.<br>
<br>
This tripel is a very easy drinker. Juicy, refreshing flavors with just a hint of spice make it hard to slow down. The finish is a touch dry which keeps me coming back for more.<br>
<br>
Bosprotter is a tripel I've never seen before and I'm glad I picked it up. It's a nice surprise to come across a solid beer like this every now and then. The smell and flavors all come together nicely to create an easy drinker. I wouldn't mind picking up a couple more bottles of this in the near future.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">2,186 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 19, 2008",4,4,4,,4.5,4,joe1510

Got a lot of caramel malt and a good bit of citrus hops in the scent. OK, but certainly not nearly on the same scent level as the likes of Maharaja or Hercules.<br>

Taste followed the nose with orange hops and a caramel base. I felt the combo was pretty spot on, but it was pulled back a bit...was hoping for more wallop!

<br>
On tap at the Alamo Draft house. Served in a 12 oz. tulip.<br>

Look- Tangerine amber, opaque, but not particularly hazy. Ring of suds persists until the glass empties. Good lacing for 9%.<br>
<br>
Smell- Biscuit, lemon candy, grass. Clean, but nothing special.<br>
<br>
Taste- Follows the nose. Moderately bitter, mild tangerine, resin, dry pine finish. Not boozy at all. Again, it's clean and pleasant, but nothing special for a DIPA. +.5 for masking the above-average ABV. Too much bittering without substance for my liking.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel- Sharp carb, medium body, light feel. Moderate astringency.<br>

Overall- Pleasant enough, but nothing special, and not easy drinking enough for a ""subtle"" beer. Feels like a few tweaks and a later hop addition would take this one over the top.

From the bottle: ""Bend. Oregon"".<br>

I was anxious to get started, so following the Pop! of the cap, I performed an aggro pour. This resulted in the unbidden creation of two-plus fingers of solid, foamy, rocky, tawny head that looked like meringue atop the beer. Color was solid Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a mélange of qualities, including tropical fruit, cattiness, grapefruit &amp; even some pine. Oooh! This makes my hophead self VERY happy. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste began with a strong tropical fruitiness, then slowly gave way to the grapefruit bitterness as well as the cattiness noted on the nose. I did not taste pine, so maybe I was hallucinating when I smelt it on the nose. Good golly, but it was leaving some incredibly dense, sticky lacing behind as I drank it! Finish was dry &amp; bitter, more towards grapefruit &amp; cattiness than tropical fruit, but it was fine by me since it satiated my hops jones for the time being.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,106 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 11, 2017",3.75,4,4,-0.8%,4.25,3.75,woodychandler

<br>
S- not strong. Initially a little chocolatey, later a little bit cherry. Nothing special. Smells a lot like the porters I've had.<br>
<br>
T- taste as it smells, but a bit stronger. There is a definite strong boozy taste. Not sure why if its 7%! For sure a sweet malty taste forward along the booze, subtle hop. Noticing as the beer warms, there is a lot more flavor. Slight grapefruit and light pine hop. The booze mellows as it warms. After taste is a burt feel, and lingers with a nibbling sweetness. Im not sure the sweetness is better than the burnt.<br>
<br>
Feel- kind of water, though it coats the tongue and lingers like New Belgium's Portage. The carb makes it feel like champagne a bit. Not so wonderful, not dreadful.<br>
<br>
Overall- boozey, balance of sweet lingering roasted malt and a zesty hop. Champagne fizz is not expected from the ales I am accustomed to. And the strong booze taste seems amature spiked in the middle of what would taste like a decent porter.

Flavor is of nutty malt and floral hops with a backing of slightly medicinal yeast esters in the finish. A light roast and mineral notes suggest a clean bill of health for this Altbier. Mouthfeel is creamy and full-bodied, but it drinks easily with a crisp, drying finish. Overall, a very drinkable Alt from the good folks at (512).

Poured a medium golden amber that is translucent with perhaps just the slightest of sediment. Produced a bone white head that quickly fleeted to just a shadow atop the brew and an inconsistent lacy ring around the glass. The smells are great! Like many west coast dIPA's, it has a piney type aroma. Dark hop resin. There is slight fruity/dish soap smells, but this is definitely a rustic, pine hop smell. The tastes mirror these aromas. It may not be out of the brewery fresh, but it's pretty recent. There is a great bitterness to it. I don't see any IBU listings on the bottle, but it has to be high. The bitterness doesn't quickly fade but gets comfortable on the lips. A great beer. Reminiscent of Dreadnaught. If you can find it, scoop this one up. Another win for Oregon beer!<br>

A: A vigorous pour into a goblet reveals a lot of fine, swirling bubbles, and a moderate white head that slowly recedes, leaving persistent lacing. The beer is slightly hazy, and has a nice apricot color. I enjoyed watching it settle, much like a cask beer drawn from a beer engine.<br>

Smell: sweet, chocolatey aroma with a little bit of burnt roastiness thrown in. There's also a bit of vegetal hoppiness toward the end. Smells like a decent porter or maybe even a schwarzbier.<br>

3.88,53808,"A solid, if unexceptional IPA. I happen to like the look of unfiltered beer, and the look of this ale is perhaps the strongest thing about it, even though it doesn't retain much of a head. The smell is suitably hoppy, somewhat citrusy.  The flavor is pleasant. A tad bit more piney than is my preference. A slight bitterness remains at the back of the throat. Carbonation is moderate.<br>

Appearance: Orange-yellow with a fluffy white head that lingers before fading to a nice lacing on the top of the beer.<br>
<br>
Aroma: A nice amount of hops here, citrus, grapefruit, and a small amount of pine. Straight forward and to the point but enjoyable.<br>

Taste: There is a nice lingering bitterness, more like an IPA than a pale ale. Grapefruit is the predominate flavor with a sweet malty backbone.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel: Dry finish and a lingering bitterness. It has medium carbonation and a medium body. Nice easy to drink, especially on hot days.<br>

A - the aroma is fresh grass, light pine and some big citrus (orange pretty much) with a caramel malt backbone<br>

T - ok I have never consumed the orange influenced cleaning products whatever they are called but I can imagine it could taste similar if it were diluted &amp; chilled... Maybe not but you get the point. I think the heavy orange citrus and combo of pine create this. It's got a good malt presence for balance and although my first thought was cleaning product it's not bad. Dry finish, no alcohol present.<br>
<br>
M - meh.... Medium body minimal carbonation, slight crisp feel. Refreshing and easy to drink.<br>

O - I find it strange that the aroma is so much bigger than the flavor, this beer is not bad maybe more complexity among fruitiness and different hop profiles would help or less of the current.

<br>
Last night I was reading the latest BA magazine, with the feature on Altbier. I was very interested, and disappointed at the statement regarding it's unavailability in the US. So when I walked into Billy's, I was pleased to see (512) had stepped up to make a very ambitious style, the Alt.<br>
<br>
I have no ""real"" altbier experiences to compare this to, but here goes.<br>
<br>
Color is a medium-dark amber with a solid creamy head. <br>
<br>
Smell is fresh, there are familiar sweet notes that I just can't put my finger on. <br>
<br>
Taste is great, for the color I was expecting something a lot heavier. It's refreshing but substantial.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel is reminiscent of Harp, again, substantial without being too heavy.<br>

Dark-brown and cloudy in appearance, the pint glass I was handed had been pre-poured, so I can't say a lot about the head.

3.77,43534,"Served on-tap at the Crown &amp; Anchor Pub. Pitcher into a standard pint glass.<br>
<br>
(512)'s Pale pours a deceptively hazy amber-orange body with a big, fluffy head that doesn't budge for quite some time. Minimal lacing, but that's likely a result of the glassware. Enticing aroma, with fresh fruit and piny hops dominating. A modest backbone of biscuit &amp; caramel malt makes an appearance, but the sweet, lighter yeast &amp; hop notes are the showcase here.<br>
<br>
Flavor falls a bit outside of the Pale Ale style, as a lengthy hop bitterness pushes the IBU's into the IPA range. Malts taste a bit roasted and slightly burnt, but a floral hop kick and sweet fruit notes of mango and apple make for a tasty flavor profile overall. However, the body is a bit on the thick side, and although it's well carbonated, the bitter finish wears at the drinkability. Overall, a decent Pale Ale by an up-and-coming Austin brewery.

4.48,43534,"Let me start at the end and work backwards.<br>
<br>
I could drink this stuff until I fall of the chair. This is exactly the sort of beer that I like to sit down with and drink all night long. It's got plenty of character and bags of flavour. There's a vague hint of citrus but not too overpowering, and the hops don't hit you in the face. I like a hoppy beer but not purely for the sake of it - there's got to be a reason and a malt balance. If I was given this in a blind tasting I might almost call it Belgian, although I'd know that it wasn't.<br>

3.88,43534,"Appearance - This brew pours a transparent golden orange color, and produces a 1 1/2 finger head. As the head dissipates it leaves behind moderate lacing.<br>
<br>
Smell - The smell shows off the malt build - malty, bready, caramel, and crackers. There is a note of distant bittering hops. Strap yourselves in - get ready for a malty pale ale!<br>
<br>
Taste - I really like how this pale ale stands apart from the other pale ales here in Texas. It has malty front end leads nicely to a pleasant bitter finish. More English style in it's approach I would say. Very striking, there aren't too many pales out there like this. Notes of toffee and caramel in the front. Almost pinelike in the finish.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is pretty good here. There is a bitterness lingers after the brew washes over the tongue. Prickly carbonation. This brews is neither oily nor sticky.<br>

Drinkability - The drinkability on this pale is pretty good. There are a lot of choices when it comes to pale ales in Texas, but this is a very unique Texas pale.

3.48,64765,"12oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry’s in Spokane for $1.59. No freshness date, although the label states “Seasonal Release Winter 2014,” so I think we’re good, but I can’t help wonder if they mean the 2013-14 winter or the 2014-15 one. Incidentally, the label is different than the one pictured on BA, and states the abv clocks in at an even 7%.<br>
<br>
Poured a hazy, dark mahogany shade, with a big, creamy and bubbly tan head. Lots of lace.<br>
<br>
Spicy and malty in the nose, initially. Some piney hops are detected, along with what I swear was a little whiff of cherry.<br>
<br>
The taste was similar to the smell, though things stood out a little more. Along with some piney and peppery hop notes, I also definitely got an undercurrent of slightly sour cherry flavor. Midway through comes a dry, mineralish flavor that dominated the aftertaste in a somewhat overbearing way, along with the slightly weird, quasi-Belgian cherry sourness.<br>
<br>
Medium bodied, with a dry, prickly mouthfeel.<br>
<br>
Interesting, but needs improvement. I have to wonder at the slightly sour fruitiness, if it’s a Belgian-influenced thing going on or just a complete accident. The mineral note needs to be dialed down, as it really amps up way too much in the latter part of the taste. If that were toned down, this would be more drinkable. As it stands, it’s okay, but nothing to seek out again.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,363 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 14, 2014",3.5,3.75,3.5,-4.1%,3.75,3.25,woemad

The body of this brew is right on par with one would expect for an American Style Pale Ale. Somewhat pale, dark amber color, with a good amount of head and some decent lacing.<br>

This somewhat full looking body carries over into the nose, with a good dose of hops, but a very potent sweet, citrus flavor actually dominates the nose of this brew. <br>
<br>
First sip is a hint of caramel and a very potent sweet, melon-like bubble-gum flavor. Hops are there, but for as sweet as this beer is, could stand to be stronger to help balance out the flavor. The sweet, bubble-gum like taste rides through until the end, but the hop bitterness does a decent job of cleaning things up at the tail-end of the sip. Mouthfeel is pretty good for the style, although a little more body wouldn't hurt.<br>
<br>
The first time I tried this beer, I thought it wasn't too bad, but the sweet flavors of this pale are rather odd and just aren't doing it for me.

The nose offers a great mixture of tropical fruits like grapefruit, tangerine, guava, and a few others, as well as a malt aroma that almost imperceptibly blends into the main show. The flavor is also boldly fruity but a bit diminished from the nose, fairly and refreshingly bitter, dry, and also carries just a touch of the malt aspect. The body is medium weight, a tad syrupy, and well carbonated.<br>

<br>
It looked very appetizing. It had all of the hallmarks of what you'd expect to see in a double IPA. It even smelled very hoppy and full of citrus. It seems all good on that front, but there's one main problem. <br>
<br>
The taste was, at least to me, very weak for a DIPA. It wasn't bad, and it was not terrible. It was simply not as hoppy and complex as I thought it should have been. I can taste the hops, the sweetness, and the alcohol coming through. However, it's not as nuanced and as hoppy as I thought it should have been. <br>
<br>
Overall, if they are going to make it again, I hope they kick couple of notches up in the complexity department. With more practice, I'm sure 512 would do a very good job, though. Until then, I'll go elsewhere for a Double IPA.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">792 characters</span><br><br>","Sep 04, 2011",3.5,4.5,4,-6.3%,4.5,3,2xHops

from cask, so not much head or carbonation, but thats expected... Got my pint, and the first thing I smelled was orange juice. Wha? yes. n the nose ended up being a mixture of orange/grapefruit juice. this is by far the most citrus I have ever smelled on anything excluding juice... possibly.<br>
Taste is exactly the same, I want this for breakfast, this is incredible... more incredible is knowing that it is 9% alcohol.

First off: this was the end of the keg. I got about half a chalice of it, but I got that for free!!! So free beer is always good.<br>
<br>
Being the end of the keg, there was tons of head, but when that died off, the beer was burnt orange.<br>
<br>
I was in a bar, so my already weak nose can't give a review of this.<br>
<br>
The flavor doesn't have much of a hop bite, maybe this is because it's the end of a keg, but that was a disappointment. The rest of the flavor was a nice carmel malt flavor with a decent bitter finish.

A: Pours a dark and hazy reddish/copper color. A two finger white head forms with good retention. Plenty of sticky lace is left behind.<br>

A - Brown, semi-opaque an somewhat cloudy/murky. Almost o head built of, thin lacing and halo round the glass<br>
<br>
S - Great! Lactic, funk, leather, brown malt, some spice, slight smoke.<br>
<br>
T - A lot less acidic than the nose suggests. Surprising lack of fruit. The malt and the yeast/bacteria pretty much carry all the flavor here. Funk, light tartness, not very sour, leather, spice and malt. Some smoke lingering on the finish. Little ash/char<br>
<br>
M - Carbonation was moderate. Not overcarbonated or flat. Very dry thin body to this one.<br>
<br>
O - Excited to see this glimpse into the souring of a beer. It has all indications of going in a great direction. The bottles should age well as i think the brett is far from done doing it's work. The two barrels they held back for further aging should progress into something very nice. Definitely recommend trying now and grabbing hold of a few to age...and of course anxiously awaiting the bottling of the other barrels.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,053 characters</span><br><br>","Nov 18, 2011",3.5,4,4,,4.5,3.5,jhimstedt

Look- Pours a pale yellow with a generous finger of quick diminishing white foam. <br>

Smell- Cucumber, green melon, lemongrass and very mild band aid. <br>
<br>
Taste- Cucumber forward with a hint of lemon zest. A bit of sourness in the finish. <br>
<br>
Feel- Super light with a slight tingle on the tongue to start. It finishes with a mild mouth puckering tartness. <br>

Overall- A refreshing easy drinker that reminds me of the old summer favorite of water with cucumber and lemon slices. Just with some added tartness and alcohol!

Enough bitterness to balance the malt but expected a little more. Sticky body and mouthfeel. Alcohol warming but not hot. Finish is bittersweet, aftertaste is almondy and orangey.<br>

A: Dark amber caramel color. Soft, dense, and creamy, white head. Good lacing too. Head dissipates but there is still a soft thin head left behind.<br>

S: Resiny pine and caramel malt. Fairly one dimensional for me but my nose isn't that great. Still a good double IPA, meaning lots of pine and lots of caramel. No real alcohol in there which is good. <br>
<br>
T: Lots of pine. I didn't get as much pine in the aroma as I do in the taste. Sweet pine and caramel. It is kind of like eating a pine tree, or at least it's needles. Slight alcohol in the finish.<br>

M: This is on the fuller side for a Double IPA in my book. It does however have a good dry finish. <br>

D: Very good. I really like this beer but I wouldn't say it is a great double IPA. I just think more hop aroma is needed and less body.

<br>
Label starts to make sense. So, this is sort-of a schwarzbier and not american black ale. In that case, there is a decent whiff of clove that one would expect from a dark wheat. <br>
<br>
Flavor reflects this too. Lots of clove, nutty bread and just a tiny bit of banana. Chewy, doughy texture.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel is a bit too clean. Could use more body. Still a respectable finish.<br>

Shows a deep, chestnut-copper body with the slightest hint of haze. The well-retained cap of custard head deposits thick rings of lace along the inside of the pint glass. Aroma doesn't knock my socks of with hoppiness, but instead packs nice balance of caramel malts and floral, piny hops. A bit biscuity as well.<br>
<br>
TWO could easily be mistaken for SN's Bigfoot (think 2 months old as the aggressiveness of the hops just start to fade). It's that good. Big notes of resinous, piny woodenness from the hops with some slight brandy-like booze. The malts taste equally as impressive, with honey biscuit and lightly toasted toffee. Full-bodied mouthfeel and a tightly-packed carbonation level. Never gets too heavy on the tongue, though, like some IIPA's tend to do. All in all, another well-crafted release from the talented (512). Not the hoppiest version of the style, but fans of Bigfoot will achieve beer nirvana.

A- One finger mocha head, thick and creamy with a long retention. Peaks on the head, quite nice looking. Body color is a very dark-brown, almost black. Some fluffy lacing.<br>

S- Toffee, mocha and toasty malts. Smells like a candy bar with a coffee or roast malt twinge to it. <br>

T- Strange flavor. Dark, roasted malt backbone with a surprising kick in the front. It hit me hard with alcohol, which is really strange for a 5.7 brew.

<br>
Pours dark chocolatey brown, with an abundant thick pillowy medium-tan head. Excellent retention and lacing. Very nice.<br>
<br>
Smell is nice as well, an interesting blend of light-bodied but deep-flavored chocolate malts with a touch of floral hops, and a tiny bit of orange. The kind of black ale aroma that I like, with a lovely dark-light balance and contrast. Feels light but smells dark.<br>
<br>
Taste is bland and dull. I'm struggling to pull any flavors out of it. Even accounting for the effects of altitude, there's not much to it. It's especially weird, given how pleasant and varied the smell is. It's not bad, but it's nearly flavorless.<br>

Mouthfeel is fine. Light-bodied, plenty of carbonation.<br>

Aroma is strong and sweet with tropical fruit notes like guava and mango. <br>

The taste does not follow the smell but it is still very interesting.  I get more stone fruit out of the hop profile - maybe nectarine and peach up front with the tropical fruit in teh back along with a moderate bitterness and sticky sweet malt backdrop.  It is almost candy-like.  Almost too much but I think they pull it off really well so no down votes here.  The aftertaste is just the bitterness which I like in this kind of beer...  reminds you that it is still an IPA.<br>

<br>
Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not getting a lot of hops out of it as I pour it. Fresh beer aroma with hops, yes, but nothing specific. Very hazy golden body. Frothy bright white head. Putting my nose to it there's more. It's resinous, and what a lot of people describe as dank (dank:  [daNGk]  adjective  disagreeably damp, musty, and typically cold). I do get a kind of a smell of marijuana though, although I think they're using the word wrong. Citrusy, and with some pine as well. The citrus is probably mainly grapefruit, but I think there's some orange as well. It's not a bad aroma, but it's not as bright as I'd expected. Moving forward, the flavor follows. There's an added light note of mintiness to the hops, and the malt is biscuity and toasty. I was hoping the ""dank"" character would have followed but it comes off more as a kind of vegetal note, kind of like the stem of a tomato-plant - at least more so that than marijuana. ""Apocalypse""? I think not. Decent enough? OK. It's floral as well, and the malt has a slight edge of honey and caramel to it. It's nicely balanced with a stiff bitterness, and it finishes dry, grassy, piney, and somewhat mineralish. Medium leaning toward medium-light in body and ""fizzy"". As it warms it improves and I'm finding an almost peach or apricot-like note, and more soft grapefruit.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,481 characters</span><br><br>","Feb 21, 2017",3.75,4,3.75,-2.3%,3.75,3.75,NeroFiddled

<br>
A: Ruby-brown with 1-finger of beige, foamy head with decent retention but spotty lacing.<br>
<br>
S: Mild dark maltiness, some raisin and fig/date, medium and dark caramel crystal malts, and floral and light citrus/pine notes.<br>
<br>
T: A very substantial and enjoyable beer -- reminds me of Avery Old Jubilation Ale but a little less old ale-ish. Excellent medium and dark crystal malt caramel notes with a little bit of a rum raisin and date profile. Hopping is pretty hefty but balanced with mostly floral but accents of pine, honeysuckle, and orange/grapefruit citrus. A little bit of yeast ester, nothing too much but a little fruity, and alcohol is well-hidden. Moderately bitter but well-balanced. <br>
<br>
M: 10 Barrel does a nice job of keeping this beer smooth and drinkable, body is medium leaning toward medium-full, but it finishes very dry for a beer of its ABV without seeming watery. Carbonation is low-medium which also helps the drinkability.<br>

Nose is super malty and fruity...almost to the point of being musky; not unlike sour cherries. Malts are like heavy caramel syrup. Maybe a bit of herbal hops in here, but the near-sourness/raspberry syrup nose is the most prominent.<br>

Very heavy beer with the malts playing the most prominent role - dark, cherry infused toasted toffee. Burnt toast mingles with some dark raisins, but the fruitiness found in the nose is nowhere near as prominent in the taste. Little bit of hops are in there to help with some sort of semblance of balancing, but this thing is hellified malty. Mouthfeel is very full and almost chewy.

Poured into straight pint glass. Whooosh! The first slight pour produced about 1/10 inch of beer and the rest of the glass full of foam. It took a goodly while (minutes) to settle to the point where I could pour more beer. And the same results occurred throughout the life of the bottle. Eventually I ended up with a beer that was a lightly translucent black with a thick tan head that (obviously) had good retention and moderate lacing.<br>

The aroma still had some nice floral hops, some grain, a light touch of roast and enough hoppiness to provide a clue that this may have been a hop-bomb when fresh. The roast was much more noticeable on the tongue, there was a decent amount of base grains and still a touch of citrus hops in back.<br>

The body was typical for a CDA, which is what I think this beer is. Drinkability was very good, especially considering that CDA's really aren't my favorite style and the age of this brew.

Taste follows up closely on the smell. Corn, coriander, and a frankly indiscernible but nonetheless pleasing blend of spices. Some what elements. There's also a slightly off vegetal note, but it's not terribly distracting.<br>
<br>
The mouthfeel was, sadly, fairly undercarbonated. Despite flawless packing on htomsirveaux's part, I appreciate that this week-old growler naturally lost quite a bit of carbonation in transit. <br>
<br>
Should I ever make my way to Texas, I'll be excited to try this beer on tap. A nice take on the style - (512) is a brewery I'll be keeping my eye on.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,155 characters</span><br><br>","Oct 14, 2011",2,3.5,3.5,-8.4%,4,3.5,amphion1065

Beer size: 22 oz. brown bottle. <br>
Glassware:Seidel mug<br>
<br>
The pour was delicate and slightly foamy. The color was black with dark red hues. Not really that translucent. It left a light brown-tan head which dissipated quickly. It had an attractive lace down and around the sides. I nursed this beer for 1 1/2 hours. A thoughtful drink. <br>
<br>
The smell was slightly sweet with hints of caramel, dark bread, and yeast. A little hint of hop and malt. <br>
<br>
Going in, the taste had a sweet, caramel sensation. The aftertaste was dry, slightly bitter, a little metallic (not enough to ruin the overall taste and roasted dark chocolate/coffee flavor). <br>
<br>
The mouthfeel was medium bodied, not too complex.The overall taste combination lingered on my palate for a while. <br>

This beer is above average. It is not a beer I would go searching for. It still needs work. I have had better dark beers. It was like drinking a medium porter with a pale ale quality.

(512)'s Wit pours with a glowing, almost artificial-looking orange-creamsicle hue. The hazy body supports a stubborn dollop of eggshell-white foam--creamy and dense. Nice aroma on this witbier, although I got slightly more of a hefeweizen vibe from it. Bread crust and orange peel alongside a spicy hop variety and a hint of coriander.<br>
<br>
The flavor matched the aroma well, and I appreciated the subtlety of the spices. Too much coriander and orange peel can definitely be a bad thing, but in this beer it is just right. Spices and some german-esque hops balance nicely with a well-crafted malt bill that adds a backbone of crackers and sweet bread. Mouthfeel is both crisp and juicy at once, with a medium-light body that finishes with a drying bite. Very refreshing witiber, and despite the 20-degree temperatures, it held its own on a brisk winter afternoon. Quaffable, tasty, and smooth.

Crumbled chocolate, a touch of tangy dark fruit. The whiskey is well integrated, lending tangy booze to the chocolate malts. Pecans actually take a backseat. As it warms, sweet caramel and toasted bread emerge. Lingering chocolate bitterness and a finish of dry pecans. <br>
<br>
Carbonation from the appearance carries into the mouthfeel, exploding when it hits the tongue. This is the main downside to the brew -- I want a heavy, thick, creamy body, not crazy Belgian bubbles. <br>

4.1,53957,"On-tap at the Draught House 41st Anniversary party. Randallized through Centennial hops.<br>
<br>
Appropriately, (512)'s Bruin pours, well, brown. Murky, muddy brown with a good depth to the caramel core. A foamy sand head settles nicely, draping rings of lacing along the inside of my tasting glass (probably due to the hop addition). Aroma is a pleasing blend of caramel and toffee, with a light dusting of chocolate and coffee. The Centennial hops are faint-smelling, but throw in a pinch of musty, earthy citrus.<br>
<br>
Very good flavor on this beer--in my opinion one of (512)'s better releases as of late. Loads of toasted caramel malt and rich, buttery English toffee lay down a thick, chewy backbone within which lighter notes of chocolate and citrus zest reside. The hops add a healthy dose of bitterness to the finish, but this baby is a bonafide MALT BOMB. Thick, rich mouthfeel that could use a touch more carbonation, but is otherwise a delight to consume. One of my top beers of the evening, which is saying a lot given the incredible line-up that the Draught House presented to its loyal, imbibing followers.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,109 characters</span><br><br>","Nov 08, 2009",4,4,3.5,,4,4.5,wagenvolks
4.03,53957,"Labeled a double brown ale by the brewery, and ""at once cuddly and ferocious.""<br>
<br>
Served from the tap a robust-looking brown color with a solid finger of head filling up the brewery's own pint glass. Bruin looks a little prettier than your run-of-the mill brown, and if there can be such a thing as a double brown, this appearance seems fitting. <br>
<br>
Aroma from Bruin is a little muted by the temperature of the beer, but in time nice roasty malt notes come through, along with a bit of hops. These same hops are the first thing I notice when I sip. They're not in-your-face bitter and don't skirt the edges of the style, but rather they complement the more traditional maltiness of Bruin while still being a dominant aspect of the beer. The flavor really reminded me of a Sierra Nevada beer in the way the hop notes were so well-integrated and balanced that they seemed natural. Well done, (512).<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel was a slight letdown, as I was hoping for a more substantial body from this self-proclaimed double. I expected something creamier like I'd experienced in DFH's Indian Brown or Palo Santo. Nevertheless, Bruin did drink smoothly, and it was an improvement on the watery mouthfeel I've often found in lesser brown ales.<br>
<br>
I found Bruin to be a winner-- easy to drink and well-crafted. It's a privilege to have the likes of this beer and (512) Pecan Porter brewed locally.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,371 characters</span><br><br>","Nov 07, 2009",3.5,4,4,,3.5,4.5,Riccymon

This winter ale offers flavors of caramel, nuts, and bread with a candy- like character showing its face with each sip.

I feel lucky because I have gotten to see this brew evolve from the first batch (which was just okay) to the latest batches, and it has become undeniably solid. Good job, Kevin.<br>
<br>
Appearance - This brew pours a hazy light golden orange color - translucent like a Wit should be. It produced a 2 finger head white fluffy head, which leaves light lacing behind as the head dissipates. A quick swirl of the glass brings the head back, that dissipates even quicker - demonstrating okay head retention. There is a constant stream of carbonation bubbles that rise up from the bottom. <br>
<br>
Smell - This is a pretty good smelling witbier. I can get notes of grapefruit peel and coriander. It is yeasty with light floral hops notes and wheat. Almost bubblegumy. Light citrus. Opting for grapefruit peel instead of orange peel is a very nice take on this style.<br>
<br>
Taste - This is a great tasting witbier. It has flavor notes of light grapefruit, coriander, and a hint of bubblegum. Light citrus twang and crispeness from the grapefruit. Even, smooth, and delicate - very balanced. The coriander is light and even - Kevin doesn't beat you over the face with it. The grapefruit in this witbier makes it very unique.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is good for a witbier - soft and almost chewy. I would have a liked a little crispness from the carbonation, but the carbonation level is a little low.<br>

<br>
Appearance: murky dark amber-brown hue with a moderate effervescence. Head is a finger of frothy tan foam. Not bad!<br>
<br>
Smell: caramelly malt with a bit too much sweetness and a biscuity malt character. Kind of like a too-sweet amber ale; not my favorite.<br>
<br>
Taste: sweet and caramelly with a bit of biscuity character. Bitterness toward the end is balanced. Flavor works a little bit better than the aroma, but in general it's not to my taste.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel: medium body with a decent carbonation and an OK creaminess. Not outstanding, but it works well enough.<br>
<br>
Overall: this beer definitely seems more like an amber ale or a winter warmer -- definitely not a strong ale in any sense of the term.

3.56,64765,"A winter warmer is a traditional malty-sweet English Strong Ale that is brewed in the winter months. It is usually quite dark, but not as dark as a stout, with a big malt presence. Sometimes, winter warmers have a few spices, especially in the United States, although spices are not necessarily a required ingredient in a winter warmer. The primary characteristic is strength; the average alcohol content by volume ranges from 6.0% to 8.0% ABV and some Winter Warmers reach 10% ABV or more. Christmas beer is another type of winter warmer, similarly strong in alcohol content and usually spiced.<br>
The above is copied from Wikipedia, I use this as a starting place since this is my first Winter Ale. Pray for snow meets most of that...I will definitely ugly add Winter ales to the list to find the best of them.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">809 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 23, 2013",3.25,3.25,3.5,-1.9%,3.5,3.75,ssteakley

Purchased: Received in a trade<br>
<br>
Appearance is highlighted by a huge head of 5 to 6 fingers, tan and frothy. I thought that may just be from the first pour, but subsequent pours are almost as massive. Color is almost completely black, save for some brown tinges seen when the glass is held to light. Super amounts of lacing and retention on this one.<br>
<br>
Aromas are of dark malts and a nice sweetness. The clean character makes me think of a schwarzbier lager, but this is an ale. No hop aromas I can detect.<br>
<br>
Taste has a nice malt-forward character, with chocolates and toasted grains. After a bit I get some bitterness, from the hops, some coffee-like flavors and from a bittersweet chocolates.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel is a medium body, clean, with moderate to high carbonation. The finish is dry and somewhat bitter, but the malts are still there. Some off flavors seem to be present as well.<br>
<br>
Overall an interesting and good beer, but not remarkable. I'm not sure what style they were after (if any) as it has characteristics of several.

There’s a good balance to it with some mild bittering. The hops present a cocoa dryness that rounds it out nicely.<br>
<br>
M: This is very thin but it doesn’t feel like it came up short, it feels intentional, and that somehow makes it ok. The lacing is fantastic, but the coating is relatively minimal, which is a bit anomalous. Again, not disappointing though. I always feel like when someone presents a black ale, it is a genre that is so amorphous it is tough to really determine what you are about to get. Someimtes you get an imperial stout monster like Labyrinth, other times you get this dapper gentleperson. Who can ever tell.<br>
<br>
D: This is exceptionally drinkable and the color is the only thing that might be offputting to people. It is a strange hybrid that brings a bit of IPA to the table and a bit of Stout in the mix. Overall, pretty solid beer and I would recommend a bomber or two to any willing participant.<br>

Narrative: The hackneyed carriage clipped along steadily over the cobblestone streets and the slick London night was further obfuscated by misty clouds. Sir Grimsly peered at his silver pocket watch and sighed at how long the opera had taken. His finely tailored suit of rich velvet fit precisely and his jet black hair was slicked with a fragrant pomade. “Carlton, please, slow a bit!” He called to the carriage driver. He lifted the lacy ebony curtain and looked out into the dark night and noticed a single cat, staring intently upon the carriage as it slid to a stop. The cat peered knowingly and its obsidian coat shined in the night. It appeared to nod and signal to the magistrate. With a blink it disappeared. Sir Grimsley looked up and noted the mandate from today’s proceedings laying on the adjacent seat, unexecuted. With a forceful sigh, Sir Grimsley signed the stay of execution and set the prisoner free. The night shone with a furious depth, the slick streets ploshed with knowing applause.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">2,427 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 06, 2011",3.5,4,4,,4,4,SubpoenaDeuces

3.33,45496,"Bomber poured into pint glass. First, not much on the head, fizzled out pretty quick. Color is a very dark amber, almost black with back-lighting. This beer is by no means elite but it is easy drinking and not bad on the tastebuds. If I was playing a few rounds of Mike Tyson's Punch Out on my NES I could run through a bomber pretty quick. I feel like I want to like this brewer so much... small OR brewer, Fonzie type names, small distribution. I'm not sure how long they have been around but would be curious.<br>
<br>
So it goes like this, there are slight coffee/chocolate notes, nice, subtle. There is almost a dry tartness to it, like sour but not quite. Something wants to make me taste fruit at the end, but there is a fleeting sense to it, like an 80's pop song, but an average 80's pop song, not terrific like Take on Me.<br>
<br>
Overall, nice beer, easy drinker, low ABV for sessioning with the pals. I like that they are a small brewer and they have great potential!!

One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing over dark brown/almost black opaque body. Nose features good dose of roasted malt balanced by floral hops.

Basic black with a short, dark tan cap that didn't linger for long. Soapy bubbles, not unusual for a cask offering. The aroma was sweet and malty, roasty with some chocolate, lactose sweetness, and a hint of spice. Bitterness was low to moderate overall, balanced to caramel malty sweetness, more lactose and milk chocolate, roast. Peppery spice showed up in the finish. This was balanced quite nicely so that you didn't notice it much at first, but it grew a little bit as you finished your pint. By the time I was done, the peppery character was prominent, but not overpowering. I don't know that it would have been enjoyable past a single pint, but I liked the one that I had.

<br>
Burnt walnut brown with rust orange edges and a massive number of uprushing bubbles. The ecru colored crown filled the vast majority of the glass on the pour and isn't shrinking very quickly. As the foam melts and becomes rocky, the beer takes on the appearance of a black cow (Coke and ice cream) or a root beer float. More sudsy ribbons of lace stick than were expected.<br>
<br>
The aroma is darker than a brown ale and lighter than a stout (but closer to the latter). That often happens when black malt is used. It's also somewhat spicy, in a phenolic way, which doesn't necessarily bode well for the flavor profile.<br>
<br>
It's highly likely that the mouthfeel is at least partly to blame, but 10 BB S1nist0r Black Ale is not a wonderful example of.... whatever style it is. Again, the use of black malt means that it tastes nothing like a brown ale. Although time is helping to calm the carbonation storm, there isn't much depth when the beer is judged on its own merits.<br>
<br>
Black licorice and dark caramel dominate the flavor profile. There's a little black tea leaf bitterness that is easily countered by a modest amount of sweetness. The result is a leveling balance, rather than the contrasting balance that most well-brewed beer delivers. A dark fruit tanginess sneaks in with continued warming.<br>
<br>
The mouthfeel is too light, regardless of the ABV. In addition, it suffers the fate of most overbubbled beer. That is, it's way too fizzy early and is borderline flat by the midway point of the bottle. With even an above average mouthfeel, the scores on either side might have been one notch higher.<br>
<br>
When properly carbonated, S1nist0r (note the buried '10') Black Ale is probably about as good as this brewery's Apocalypse IPA. If it was more easily available, I'd give it another go round to see if my suspicions are correct.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,907 characters</span><br><br>","Oct 07, 2010",2.5,4,3,-8.8%,3.5,3.5,BuckeyeNation

Cascabel Cream shows a rich darkness to the body that looks like black coffee with a few drops of milk. A wispy tan head tries its best to stick around, but doesn't last long. The aroma has a dash of spiciness, but is largely comprised of a musty, earthy roastiness and black malt husks.<br>
<br>
The flavor isn't quite what one might expect from a ""Cream"" stout, or a pepper-flavored stout either. Nice roasted notes and a drying finish of baker's chocolate and hops. More like an ""Imperial Irish Dry Stout"", perhaps? A slight hint of peppery heat does creep into the finish, but it's too little too late.

Appearance: Pours a deep amber orange with a moderate amount of bubbles. Solid finger of off white head which settles into a thin creamy layer. <br>

3.48,64765,"Appearance- Pours up a minimal amount of head which also has little retention. The head is a light to medium beige while the body is a maroonish brown that appears as a mix of light crimson and dark amber when held up to the light. Some lacing is left behind. <br>
<br>
Nose- Fairly malty. Not a lot of presence but enough to reveal noticeable aromas of brown bread, caramel, and raisins. The raisins are subtle with brown bread being the most noticeable aspect of the aroma. Swirling shows a bit more fruitiness (very mild cherries and plums) which is very weak. <br>
<br>
Taste- Fairly reflective of the nose with strong notes of brown bread and even stronger notes of caramel with both burnt and roasted aspects. Very thin raisin. These burnt and roasted qualities transition into a woodiness (mostly oak) which grows and brings up the finish. It starts off pretty thin but is a pretty bossy beer for most of the flavor profile. A low amount of heat joins in to add to the brashness. Some molasses and a bit of astringency. It's messy enough to suggest aging but just doesn't seem alcoholic enough (FYI: The bottle says 7% not 7.6%). The overall profile is very similar to a Scotch ale. A good amount of hoppiness that shows some pine, resin, and a fair amount of earwax. Lots of presence with a fair amount of complexity but the balance could be better. A little too astringent and bitter at this point to be thoroughly enjoyable. Still, an above average beer but not exactly what I would call a good beer. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation and a lot of zip. Borders on carbonic. Way too much zip for me. <br>
<br>
Drinkability- A bit abrasive but this beer still has enough attractive flavors to keep me going. Okay price. A little hot.<br>
<br>
Overall- Above average but not much more than that. I would give it a try but I don't think I will be buying it again. You also might want to age this. I think I waited a month of two on this but still think it could settle a bit more.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,973 characters</span><br><br>","Nov 14, 2013",3.25,3.5,3.5,-4.1%,3.5,3.5,artoolemomo

<br>
A: Pours nearly opaque black. A bit of brown comes in around the edges. The Petrol Station has a tendency to just fill the pint glass all the way. So little head is sitting in the glass. Though I could see from the pour a thick tan foam. <br>
S: Roasted malt, chocolate, coffee. A bit acrid and astringent. Light on the peppers.<br>
T: A big malt bomb. Coffee, chocolate, and lots of roast. An acrid and metallic flavor as well. Some hot Chile peppers linger. This does not mesh well.<br>

S - Malts and molasses, some hints of smoke, and just a touch of chocolate.<br>

T - Although generally, this tastes ok, this comes off as a beer that doesn't quite know what it wants to be. It is a VERY dark brown ale, or a weak American porter.

M - Highly carbonated, medium bodied. Fairly smooth but a bit thin, and not a real standout.<br>

S: Moderate aromas of tropical/passionfruit, tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit rind, and herbal hops over the top of light aromas of biscuit, toasted, and caramel malts.<br>
<br>
T: Upfront there are moderate flavors of biscuit, caramel, and toasted malts with a light to moderate amount of caramel sweetness.

M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Light to moderate amounts of dryness in the finish.<br>

<br>
Smells of powder biscuits, pineapple, peaches and mango, damp, musty boards and maybe a little bit of pee.<br>

A solid, substantial, biscuity, malt body with a pleasing array of sweet, flowery tropical fruit notes tending more toward the fruity aromatic rather than citric bitterness, although I do get some orange and grapefruit. Ends fairly quickly with minty herbs and a little pine.<br>

Feel is medium-full and smooth with just enough carbonation to get the job done.<br>

<br>
Appearance - Pours near black with dark mahogany brown edging where light can penetrate. Broken layer of suds with a thin ring around the edge of the cup.<br>
<br>
Smell - Malty, with light brown sugar notes, nutty pecan and a distant powdered cocoa character.<br>

Taste - Follows the nose with sweet and earthy flavors upfront with brown sugar, light pecan and faint cocoa flavor. A bit more earth and pecan hit in the finish.<br>

<br>
Overall - A mighty fine porter, but didn't quite live up to the expectations that the hype train behind it had bestowed upon me. Of course I've always noticed a dip in the strength of flavor with every beer I've had on nitro, so that could be an issue here too.

3.02,45496,"A- The bottle says Black Ale, and I was hoping for something along the lines of a dark thick beer, especially when you have a name like Sinistor Black. But the beer is more the color of Orval bottle glass, perhaps a shade darker. There is a decent amount of head, but it fades fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
S- This has some nice chocolate and coffee notes to it. It reminds me of the Quilter Irish Death by Iron Horse. There is something meaty about the chocolate smell.<br>
<br>
T- Well this tastes more like an American Porter. There is a mild amount of coffee, and chocolate flavors. But nothing about this beer, other then perhaps its color would even make me think Brown Ale. Perhaps that is just a mistake by the person who added the beer to the site. I'm saying this is more of a porter then anything else. It isn't too bad, it is a bit weak, but it grows on you.<br>
<br>
M- This is where I find the biggest let down with the beer. I mean cool label, great name, I'm looking for something thick black potent. But not the case, this beer is thin, and I mean thin. I was expecting to have to chew a bit, just based off the name, instead I ended up with carbonated water. I've actually had water thicker then this. If I were to look at this as an American Porter I can see how a thin mouthfeel would fit, but I wasn't expecting this, and it bugged me the whole time I was drinking this.<br>
<br>
D- If I were to use the Bud Light scale of drinkability (as in thin and completely chugable) then this would be spot on. This does have nice flavors, and is easy to drink quickly.<br>

I added this beer and, yeah, that's REALLY how they spell it...numbers replacing letters, so cute...<br>
<br>
A: dark, dark brown - falls short of 'black'; has a faint reddish tint. Poured with a short head, maybe a quarter-finger(?). Fades rapidly to a swirl of film and clinging ring.<br>

S: Husky aroma of dry grains and a notable smokiness. Kind of a 'smoky ashtray', not necessarily bad.<br>

T: Bready malt, toasted to the point of being akin to 'burnt'. Caramel lends a sweetness, some spicier wheat, twist of lemon. The type of beer style (as mentioned in Reddiamond's first review, 'Cascadian Ale') that's a new flavor - intriguing enough for more. Roasted nuts and a cocoa residue in the finish. <br>
<br>
M: Just a little thin, not watery. Surprisingly 'refreshing', a modest crispness and carbonation.<br>

3.91,45496,"Wildfire's Black Ale is a beer in search of both a name and a style category. Though the Cascadian black ale may soon gain recognition as a distinct style, I still think of black ales - even enjoyable ones such as this - as conceptual outcasts. They lack the affirmed roastiness of stouts and porters and often taste so similar to ambers or reds that I have to ask, what's the point? Why take what is otherwise an amber or pale ale recipe and add just enough black patent malts or roast barley to paint it black while leaving the taste essentially the same? Is this novelty or innovation? <br>
	<br>
Either way, Wildfire's Black Ale gives me no cause for complaint, for it is a genuine pleasure to consume. It is a very chocolaty beer not far removed from a brown ale but in a darker shade of chestnut. It has a chocolaty aroma, a solid head, and wild abstract lace. The body appears clear in the sense of lacking haze or particulate matter, but is nearly opaque brown. It tastes smooth and malty with solid but not overpowering bittering courtesy of Perle hops.

3.24,54905,"Served on-draught into a 5 oz sampler glass at the Draughthouse in Austin, Texas. Reviewed from notes. 2013 vintage.<br>
<br>
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. <br>
<br>
Pours a one finger wide head of tan colour. Good creaminess and thickness. Retention is bad - less than one minute. Lacing is inconsistent.<br>
<br>
Body colour is an opaque solid black; pretty predictable for a porter. No floating yeast particles or sediment is visible. It's definitely to style, and looks good. Not unique or special, but there are no overt flaws.<br>
<br>
Sm: There's a definite bourbon presence. Hints of vanilla, oak barrel, and lovely milk chocolate. Dark malts. Chocolate malt. Maybe some booze. Pecan nut is a highlight here; I also get some hazelnut which complements it nicely. Strangely, the pecan is more developed and evocative here than I remember it being in the base beer. I like the aroma; it's very inviting. No yeast character/hop profile is detectable. I'm really looking forward to trying it. A pleasant aroma of moderate strength.<br>
<br>
T: Quite sweet - overly so. Sweet bourbon-induced vanilla notes, sweet chocolate, and a kiss of oak. Heavy dark malts and chocolate malts fill out the body, but sadly there's little roasted barley character to be found. Cream. Marshmallow. The pecan is quite timid (just like it was in the disappointing base beer). The barrel notes don't overwhelm the base, but they don't really complement the base either. I'd love more oak - ideally with some toasty or charred character. It has nice complexity, but not enough subtlety. Needs more of a sweet/bitter balance. Some cola and sassafras notes. <br>
<br>
As it warms, I pick up some licorice and molasses.<br>
<br>
There's no perceptible hop presence, nor do I pick up nay yeast or overt alcohol. Below average depth of flavour. Average duration and intensity of flavour. <br>
<br>
Mf: A bit creamy. Smooth and wet. Slick. A bit syrupy and thick. Full-bodied. Has a ice presence on the palate. Well carbonated. A bit more dryness and coarseness would help coax out more depth of flavour.<br>
<br>
Not oily, astringent, hot, boozy, gushed, or harsh.<br>
<br>
Dr: Hides its ABV well. Quite drinkable. It's an enjoyable barrel aged imperial porter from 512, and I'd get it again. But it's far from world class, and the reticence of the pecan is very disappointing. I'd recommend this to friends, but this is only good where it has the potential to be great.<br>

08.20.17 2nd impression from a 2014 vintage bottle (fifth bottling):<br>
<br>
""Whiskey Barrel Aged Double Pecan Porter."" ""Ale brewed with pecans and aged in oak whiskey barrels."" 8.20% ABV.<br>
<br>
""...aging in recently emptied oak whiskey barrels for two months.""<br>
<br>
Served cold into a teku.<br>
<br>
HEAD: Fizzy and thin. Khaki-tan in colour. Recedes quickly, moving from ~9cm to ~4cm within 30 seconds and dying completely within a couple minutes. Not as creamy, robust, or enticing as would be ideal.<br>
<br>
BODY: Opaque black. No yeast/lees are visible within.<br>
<br>
AROMA: Caramelized gooey pecan is present, though it's far more subdued than one would expect in a beer marketed so heavily towards the pecan angle. Dark malts, specialty chocolate malts, charred oak barrel with some whiskey heat but no whiskey peat or spice, and nougat.<br>
<br>
Suggests a sweet imperial porter with faint whiskey notes. I imagine more time in barrels would help the aroma (its scant two months doesn't seem to be cutting it judging by the aroma). No overt hop aromatics, yeast aromatics, booze, or off-flavours are present.<br>
<br>
TASTE: Sweet and nougaty, with a caramelized nut flavour but no vivid or expressive pecan; maybe the pecan has just faded with 3 years of aging the bottle, but 512's ordinary Pecan Porter was more committed to the titular nut than this is. <br>
<br>
Overly sweet and a bit flat in terms of malt presence, hitting on generic but thin dark malts and little else.<br>
<br>
Whiskey barrel is reticent as anticipated; its two months of aging in barrels just wasn't enough to really contribute much flavour. I appreciate 512's transparency about the aging duration, but nevertheless the whiskey aging seems more for marketing than for actual flavour yield.<br>
<br>
TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, thin, and lacking in terms of adequate body. Should be fuller-bodied, heavier, and more robust.<br>
<br>
Unrefreshing. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, rough, or scratchy.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Pretty underwhelming, all things considered. I remembered this better and it seems to have declined with age. The premise is great - who wouldn't want a whiskey barrel aged pecan imperial porter? - but the execution is flat. Drink this fresh.<br>
<br>
Constructively, I'd like to see 512 commit more to the pecans (i.e. use more), select more interesting whiskey barrels, up the malts, and let this age longer in barrels. Roasted barley could also be employed to good effect; this doesn't drink roasty as-is and a roasted pecan flavour seems apt given the premise.<br>

T&amp;gt; Dark fruits (think fig), brown sugar/carmel, a bit of wood/smokiness, and then of course the hops which taste lively and exhibit flavors of tangerine and citrus. The hops are strong and certainly aren't content to stand in the background. This one has quite a unique flavor. <br>
<br>
M&amp;gt; This beer is a treat for the mouth, thick from malt and the excess of resins from the hops. It just feels right in your mouth.<br>
<br>
O&amp;gt; A fine winter ale that is clearly for lovers of craft brew. Indeed this is perhaps the best representation of an Oregon winter ale that I've had this year. The brewers do not hold back for this brew, you can tell that their focus was to make an amazing brew first and then worry about the cost second. It's a refreshing change of pace that makes for a truly enjoyable beer.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,275 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 19, 2012",5,5,4.5,,4,4,alexrichman

3.8,64765,"22 picked up at the COOP I believe on Friday night... Paid I think $8ish... Poured into my slim tulip... tannish head sticks around for not too long.. the brew is a pretty standard deep amber.<br>
<br>
Nose shows sorta expected PNW Winter Ale notes... but done pretty well. Toasty nose and some caramel... piney and citrus hoppiness battle with the medium malt profile.<br>
<br>
Interesting piney hoppiness comes out front and quickly melts into the malts... caramel and light toffee... citrus zest hoppiness comes in on the finish.. lingers and melts with the malts... everything is surprisingly balanced.. nothing outweighs anything else... <br>
<br>
Medium boned, but seemingly high ABV for a winter warmer... A nice sipper, but the hops make me want another sip... and another. Well done across the board.<br>

4.15,53808,"Poured from bomber into a pint glass<br>
<br>
Appearance – The beer pours an orange amber color with a two finger head of white foam.  The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.<br>
<br>
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of a grapefruit citrus and some sweeter fruit of a tropical nature (papaya, tangerine and mango) with some harvest fruit of apple and peach as well.  Along with the nice fruity smells, comes a bit of a pine and grassy smell as well as some hay.  Overall the aroma is quite nice.<br>
<br>
Taste – The taste begins with a great grapefruit hop taste that is mixed with the sweetness of tropical fruits and harvest fruits that were present in the nose.  There is a little bit of a doughiness upfront which fades as the taste advances and is replaced by some toasted bready tastes mixed with a little bit more fruitiness.  While the fruitiness increases a bit in intensity, hop flavors of resinous pine and a bit of grass come to the tongue, leaving one with a rather flavorful and smooth hopped up taste to linger on the tongue.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the medium side in terms of thickness and chewiness with a carbonation level that is rather average.  For the mix of fruity, dank and lightly toasted flavors the feel is fantastic and makes for one easy drinking but robust drinker.<br>
<br>
Overall – I rather enjoyed this brew.  It has a ton of different flavors that all melded together well. Along with the great nose and feel, the combination of attributes made for a very nice drinking brew.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,608 characters</span><br><br>","Jun 21, 2016",4,3.75,4,,4.25,4.25,Darkmagus82

3.66,170128,"Bottled on 12/14/16. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours golden hazy burnt golden with a fluffy white head that falls leaving very nice retention and sticky lacing. The aromas have a nice balance between citrus and tropical notes. The citrus aromas seem to have the edge though. Lots of orange. Some bready malts in the mix. The flavors are citrus forward. Tons of orange along with some grapefruit. Hints of pine and fresh grass. Malts do their thing, but the hops shine. Solid hop flavor and hop bitterness. It's juicy and dry at the same time. Alcohol basically goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's medium-bodied with moderate to active carbonation. It's fluffy and very smooth.<br>

<br>
Bottle #00653<br>
<br>
The beer foams up upon uncapping and cutting through the rock solid wax.<br>
<br>
It pours a jet black topped by a coffee colored foam that's light and airy. This dies down in a hurry leaving liquid goodness behind.<br>
<br>
On the nose is an evident whiskey barrel influence, although my palate and sense of smell are not discerning enough to tell what particular barrels are used. <br>
<br>
I found some elements of dark cherries and bitter chocolate emerge, along with just a touch if vanilla and some leather. <br>
<br>
Time has mellowed it out a bit, with a wonderful mélange of dark cherries, dark chocolate, a subdued roast and a hint of leather. Whisky kisses the palate at the end. A true imperial porter, its body doesn't cross into heavy stout territory. Has a bitter roast which gives it a great kick. Of course it tastes great. My only regret is I may never obtain another bottle of this!<br>
<br>
Original review:<br>
<br>
This is my 500th review.<br>
<br>
The (512) Whiskey Barrel Aged Pecan Porter, on tap at Freetail in San Antonio. <br>
<br>
This pours a dark brown-black, the color of burnt oak (charred staves perhaps from a barrel ready for filling?) with a thin, tight ring of foam.<br>
<br>
The aroma has notes of bourbon mixed with a hint of dark roasted malt, the combination of their pecan porter and a barrel-aged boozy bear of a beer. As it warms there is more of a presence of dark chocolate and some coffee rounding out the aromatics, along with a touch of toffee.<br>
<br>
The flavor has a sharp, almost harsh, upfront roastiness at first but this mellows out as it warms and opens up, releasing bourbon notes along with a sharp roast and dark cocoa as well as a dry finish. It’s not a big boozy barrel-aged beer but it does warm as it warms in the most pleasing of manners.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,830 characters</span><br><br>","Nov 09, 2013",4.75,4.75,4.75,,4.5,4.75,elNopalero

2013 vintage. For a couple hours, I was referring to this brewery as ""312"". I've been drinkin' Goose Island for too long... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises cocoa nibs, light whiskey, and a touch of darkly-roasted nuts. The taste brings in more of the same, with the nuts/caramel mix (yeah, the roasted nuts have been dipped in some rich caramel now, which somehow hasn't diminished the roastiness any) taking astrong lead. The body is a more-than-stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.

Looks good: honey-amber color with a foamy plaster stuck to my glass.  Smells like Halo oranges that my girlfriend hides in my backpack.  Tastes like nectarine and peach ring candy.  Ready Victory is evident. Not that bitter. <br>
<br>
Meh. Certainly not an IPA apocalypse, more like an IPA kerfuffle.  After a coastal trail run in the rain I was hoping for more tongue searing.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">442 characters</span><br><br>","Mar 13, 2016",3,4,3,-20.7%,3,3,donkeyrunner

Poured into a tulip glass.<br>
<br>
A: Poured fairly aggressively and ended up with about 2 1/2 finger off white foamy head that diminished pretty quickly. Color is translucent honey.<br>
<br>
S: A faint apricot nose, not overpowering aromatics here.<br>
<br>
T: Again, some apricot, citrus up front, followed by nice malt middle and dry pine finish,(not a bad thing.)<br>
<br>
M: The carbonation is light to moderate with plenty of bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice peppery finish.<br>
<br>
O: Really nice IPA that hides the ABV(7%) well and is easy to drink. Another nice offering from our neighbors to the West of H Town.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">684 characters</span><br><br>","Feb 23, 2014",3.5,3.5,3.75,-9.1%,3.25,4,kennymule

<br>
Aroma: Strong notes of roasted barley, cold coffee, bitter cocoa, brown sugar, earth, and roasted pecans, the last well befitting its name. (4.0/5.0)<br>
<br>
Taste: Opens with strong roasted malt flavors, very pleasant, and largely free of acidity. Cold coffee soon follows, with a compliment of bitter chocolate. Later in the taste, the rich nuttiness of the pecans is evident, as well. Late in the taste, there is a slight earthy hop presence, and a lingering note of roasted barley and cold coffee.  (4.0/5.0)<br>
<br>
Mouth feel: Smooth, soft, very pleasant, with just the slightest sting of carbonation.  (4.0/5.0)<br>
<br>
Drinkability/notes: Unwaveringly excellent, I wish this were bottled. If you should find yourself in Austin, Texas, (512) Pecan Porter should be on your bucket list. (4.0/5.0)<br>

The aromas come off like the regular version with the chocolate and pecan but get a kick of bourbon barrel. A little sweet.<br>
<br>
Chocolate, pecan, bourbon, vanilla and at this point of the night I can't tell if the alcohol is peeking through or if it is just bourbon flavor. Lol. <br>
<br>
Some prickly carbonation and a medium body. <br>

1st pour I did easy and almost had no head or lacing in my glass. My 2nd pour, I was much more aggressive and received a nice thick mocha head that faded within a few minutes. Better lacing on my glass as well. On the nose all I get is the whiskey and pecans. Taste is pretty much the same, along with the rostaed malts. Mouthfeel is pretty weak, very thin.

4.13,53808,"Bought a sixer of this a while back, liked it. Found it in the fridge again and decided to share my thoughts.<br>
<br>
The color is orangey golden, cloudy. Somewhat see through but overall opaque. I believe this one's bottle conditioned. Pours a small head that dissipates after a minute or two but remains soapy on top. <br>
Smells hoppy, malty. It's nice. It's got your typical hop aromas, but I'm not gonna dissect them today. It's good in this department.<br>
<br>
Despite what the smell might suggest, this is not a very hoppy ipa. It is very smooth however. The alcohol has a bit of presence- possibly a bit too much for newcomers. I find it might benefit from a 1% or so reduction, taste wise, but I wouldn't claim to be firm on this. According to my roommate, it's 'got good flavor, but is a little bit strong'.<br>
The feel is a bit chewy, perhaps a bit thick, but the carbonation is on point. Good.<br>
<br>
I'd think of this less as an India Pale Ale and more... just an ale. I like it, though. Would recommend if you're in the mood for a refreshing or smooth ale. If you're looking for grapefruit, pine, etc, grab a Sculpin, or a Sherman instead. Price point is about right. 8$-10$ for a sixer. I like this one as a change of pace, might make a good starter ipa for some as well.<br>
<br>
Note that I don't know how old these were when bought. I'd like to try this one fresh if I got a chance to see how much hop flavor is present fresh.<br>
Edit: did just that, much hoppier, solid ipa. This one ages well.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,475 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 24, 2016",4,3.5,4,,4.25,4.25,Deerin

3.29,43535,"Served on-draught into a pilsner glass at a bar in Austin, Texas. Reviewed from notes. Cost was $5.00 USD. <br>
<br>
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. <br>
<br>
Pours a half finger wide head of nice creaminess and thickness. Decent lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. <br>
<br>
Body colour is a semitranslucent semitransparent copper of average vibrance. No yeast particles are visible. <br>
<br>
Sm: Floral hops, peach fruit, apricot fruit. Pale malts. Cream. No yeast or alcohol is detectable. A pleasant aroma of mild strength. The apricot is a highlight. <br>
<br>
T: Floral hops, pale malts. Peach fruit esters. Cream. Pilsner malts. Balanced and subdued. Has a low intensity of flavour for the style. Average duration and depth of flavour. Not real complex or subtle. I do like it, but there's really nothing remarkable about it. It's got good cohesion. <br>
<br>
Mf: Smooth and wet. Overcarbonated. Suits the flavour profile okay, but it doesn't seem custom-tailored specifically to it. Decent presence on the palate. Decent body. <br>
<br>
Not oily, astringent, harsh, gushed, boozy, hot, or rough. <br>
<br>
Dr: Drinkable, sure. It's certainly above average and is a likable IPA, but it's not world class by any means. I'll plan to revisit it for a more in-depth review; I did expect far better given its current high ratings. Hides its ABV well. <br>

Mellow, lightly drying finish.<br>

4.04,54905,"2013 edition of the (512) Whiskey-Barrel Aged Double Pecan Porter. 9.5% ABV. Special yearly release in the Spring. No wax around the gold cap this year like the 2012 edition had. 750ml bottle poured into a snifter glass.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Pours a viscous, oily black with a nice, dark tan head that quickly dissipates.<br>
<br>
Aroma: The nose starts off with freshly roasted coffee with a touch of vanilla. Notes of chocolate and roasted pecans abound within. It ends with a pleasant dash of spicy phenolics and whiskey.<br>
<br>
Taste: The whiskey is very upfront and direct, but not unpleasant. The flavors really come together and blend nicely in this beer. Whiskey flavors give way to the pecans. The pecans acquiesce to the vanilla and chocolate. On the finish, I get some herbal/floral hops<br>
<br>
Mouth feel: Low-medium carbonation, which gives the beer a surprisingly thin and watery mouth feel for 9.5% ABV. I'd say I'd say it's a touch or two under medium-bodied.<br>
<br>
Overall: This is a really nice beer that's well-rounded. The only thing I'd change if I could, would be the low carbonation. It didn't do so much for the beer.

3.69,170128,"Served on tap in a pint glass<br>
<br>
Appearance – The beer is served a golden orange color with a one finger head of white foam.  The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good lot of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.<br>
<br>
Smell –The aroma of the brew is strongest of a citrus hop smell of grapefruit and a bit of tangerine.  Along with these smells comes some lighter hop smells of pine and a little bit of bread.<br>
<br>
Taste-The taste begins with more crackery, but lightly doughy taste that has a decent sum of grapefruit hop and some lighter tangerine fruitiness upfront.  As the taste advances the citrus grows slightly stronger all while the doughy fades away.  Toward the end the pine and some earth start hitting the tongue balancing out the citrus and cracker nicely.  With a little bit of grass one is left with a crisp and nicely hopped taste to linter on the tongue.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is rather high.  For the crisp flavors and danker hop the feel is awesome and makes for an easy sipping and hoppy brew.<br>
<br>
Overall – This was a rather tasty brew overall.  Rather crisp and nicely hop blended with a still easy drinking feel and taste.

4.5,43535,"This was my first experience with an IPA on Nitro. We shot an episode of Locapour at Craft Pride in Austin while they were featuring (512) IPA on Nitro. <br>
<br>
You can check the episode out here to get a sense of the experience: http://locapour.tv/austin/512ipa<br>
<br>
I have been a huge fan of this beer ever since I moved to Austin back in 2011. It was on of the first local Austin craft beers I had upon my arrival. Not only is it a great IPA but it can be found at just about any bar or restaurant around town that takes beer seriously.<br>
<br>
The Nitro experience was wild. (512) IPA is very hoppy and has a very sharp finish that I would describe as almost peppery. But, the Nitro presentation rounds that out with a creamy texture and allow you to experience the beer in a whole new way. The flavors are there...they just feel different.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">827 characters</span><br><br>","Aug 01, 2013",4.5,4.5,4.5,,4.5,4.5,Locapour

3.88,54905,"2012 vintage poured from a 7450ml bottle. It poured pitch black with a huge foamy head to it. Great head retention and lacing to it as I drank it. Very nice looking beer overall. <br>
 <br>
The aroma has some very good dark chocolate flavors mixing with some sweeter, light bourbon. It's nutty, with some caramel sweetness. There is a Little coffee to it as well. It comes together well and seems very smooth for the style.<br>
<br>
There is a little more whiskey in the taste, especially in the finish. Milky chocolate with some caramel flavors add the sweet component. Again, it's got a smooth nutty flavor to it but I don't think I'd pick out pecan if didn't know they were there. Some roasted malts come out in the finish. <br>
 <br>
The mouthfeel is thin and carbonation is way too high for the style. Mouthfeel is unfortunately the downfall of this beer for me, it just doesn't fit what I expect in an imperial stout. <br>
<br>
Overall, a very solid beer but the mouthfeel did hurt it for me. The flavors come together very well though. The pecans seemed to give it a smooth nuttiness, which was pretty appealing with the chocolate and roasted malts. Pretty nice beer overall.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,150 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 09, 2012",2.5,4.5,4,-6.3%,4,4,billab914
3.7,54905,"A: poured a dark brown in color with brown highlights when held to the light with a huge 4 finger khaki colored head that left way too much bubbly lacing sticking to the glass.<br>
<br>
S: I did get plenty of whiskey heat upfront in the aroma with chocolate goodness, maybe a little pecan character but I did manage to sniff out some good wood notes, slightly dark fruits and coffee coming through as well.<br>
<br>
T: the pecan was more apparent on the palate but was still a little muted alongside great dark chocolate flavor, nice woody barrel character, sweetness from the vanilla, very well hidden whiskey boooze heat, good coffee notes and roastiness.<br>
<br>
M; the brew was medium in body with tons of carbonation which had a semi sweet, nutty, mildly dark fruity, boozy, woody frothy and creamy finish.<br>

4.21,53808,"This is one of the better IPA's I have had recently and at $2.99 a bomber around NW CO it is very good value. I am pretty sure this is hopped with Amarillo, which is one of my favorite hops. <br>
<br>
Look - Color is a clear gold with a thick white head. Good head retention and tons of lacing. It is has a west-coast look foreshadowing a lighter grain bill which I prefer. <br>
Smell - is good but underwhelming compared to some of the top notch IPA's, could be stronger. <br>
Taste - is awesome (and would be better with stronger supporting aroma). Spicy, piney and citrus bitterness explodes on the palate only slightly balanced by a light malt backbone. I get some major grapefruit!<br>
Feel- Finishes with a drying bitterness on the back of the tongue. light, crisp and dry. <br>
Overall- A very good IPA and my first beer from 10 barrel. I know they are now the ""enemy"" after being acquired by AB-Inbev  but at the price point I wanted to give them a try. If I try and remove the bias of their new ownership -  then I come away with it being a truly a great IPA.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,044 characters</span><br><br>","Oct 29, 2015",4.25,4.5,4.25,,4,4.25,CO-Bloom

4.23,54905,"Thanks to millerbuffoon for this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from wax-dipped bomber into CCB pint glass.<br>
<br>
A: Crazy dark brown in color, and opaque. Forms a huge light brown head, and this kind of looks like a Coke with a big craggy head that lasts longer. No visible carbonation, but I wonder if it exists but invisible due to the opacity of the beer.<br>
<br>
S: Whiskey, coffee, amaretto...reminds me a bit of an Irish coffee. Maybe hints of dark fruit and spices.<br>
<br>
T: Whiskey, nutty coffee, dark fruit sweetness, cacao, then more whiskey. Overall boozy impression but very tasty.<br>
<br>
M: Medium weight to mouthfeel. This has a significantly higher level of carbonation sensation than I've ever had in a porter, but it's welcome in this beer.<br>
<br>
O: This is good, quite pleasant. But for a relatively restrained ABV, I wouldn't find it to be sessionable at all - one &amp; done for me. But for a special occasion, it really hits the mark.

3.92,54905,"A: Dark cola brown in color with roughly 4 fingers of a massive mocha colored head. Tons and tons of carbonation. Head settles down quick, but remains at about a half a finger throughout<br>
<br>
S: Lots of whiskey. In fact that's most of it, lots of wood characters from the barrel and a bit of roastiness as well.<br>
<br>
T: Tons of whiskey. It tastes like it would be a significantly higher ABV than it is. After the initial blast of whiskey I picked up lots of roasted, kind of burnt chocolate flavors as well as the nutiness from the pecans.<br>
<br>
M: Very highly carbonated, but at the same time a fairly thick body and ultimately smooth. No harshness from the alcohol despite the taste.<br>

S: Lots of whiskey on the nose. Really dominates. Don't initially pick up the pecan. Get some roast and chocolate. As the head dies, I do pull some of that nuttiness.<br>

<br>
Served in a frosty 12 oz. tulip, I let it warm up for about twenty minutes before drinking.<br>
<br>
Look- Dark, dark ruby brown with a ring of toasted marshmallow/graham cracker foam that lingers until the glass is emptied. Leaves a few sticky legs.<br>
<br>
Smell- Fusel, cinnamon raisin bread, ripe banana, toasted marshmallow. Very roasty, sweet. Interesting.<br>
<br>
Taste- Woah. Banana cream pie, black cherry preserves, chocolate-dipped candied pecans. Absolutely delicious. Touch of oxidation at the end. Lingering toasted rolled oats, along with buttered pecan and a bit of lactic sweetness. I'm not one to give fives, but this is top notch.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel- Smooth, lighter than expected. Tart start, just a touch of carbonation. Rich, velvety. Substantial without getting heavy or syrupy. <br>
<br>
Oerall- Outstanding. Pecan porter is already a solid beer, but this one blows it out of the water without throwing out what makes it great and unique.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">938 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 28, 2012",4.5,4,4.5,,4,5,Lawl3ss

The beer poured a cloudy golden/orange color with a small ½-finger of white head. Retention was OK, but it only left a moderate amount of lacing.<br>

<br>
The inital pour on this results in 90% head. Yeah, this is insanely carbonated. Nice dark, near black color but I can't get over how over-carb'd this is as it almost has an appearance of a soda. Not a fan.<br>
<br>
Decent aroma of chocolate and slight booze. The light smell reminds me of a porter but I am not getting much in tne way of whiskey and very liitle nut presence.<br>
<br>
Same here with the taste as I got with the aroma. Definite rich chocolate notes. I wish there was some more whiskey and pecans to offset the dominant chocolate. The soda-esque carbonation detracts also from the taste. The flavor is pretty good but this could be outstanding with a little more finesse.<br>
<br>
If you like your beer to be similar to drinking a cola then this is your beer. Me, not so much. Why carb a beer to this degree?<br>
<br>
From what I have read, this beer has been plagued with carb issues and potential infections from the very first release. While I don't think this bottle was infected, I believe the lack of craftmanship leads to incohesion and a less than stellar brew.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,088 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 05, 2012",2.5,2.5,3.5,-19.3%,3.5,3.5,metalgdog

Draft to Pint<br>
<br>
@TheGingerMan<br>
Plano, TX<br>
<br>
App- Standard coloring of a deep DIPA. The oranges and yellows all balance out. A bit of a nice dense center with some darker center. A small 1/2"" white capped head was there and left okay cling.<br>
<br>
Smell- This was a nice and resiny DIPA. The hops are balanced with a good amount of dry grassy bitter and the citrus adds a layer of tropical fruit (Not much). This had a bit of a boozy note and not sure why with only 7%<br>
<br>
Taste- I enjoyed this DIPA. It was more akin to what I am used to in So.Cal. A deep bitter and piney resin balanced out by the semi creamy malts. A bit herbal/grassy on the finish. Nice and semi-balance.<br>
<br>
Mouth- A good and deep medium body and then more of a full medium carbonation. This one fills you up. A lot of the piney and resin remain on the back with some citrus.<br>
<br>
Drink- I really enjoyed this. Made me think I was back in SD enjoying a good west coast IPA. Id have this one again when I come back to TX.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">992 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 19, 2013",3.75,4,3.75,-7.1%,3.75,3.75,FosterJM

<br>
2012 vintage, poured into a generic cognac snifter.<br>
<br>
A: This beer poured a nice black with a HUGE tan head, even while cold. It was difficult to judge how thick the beer pours with all the head.After pouring a little and waiting for the head to dissipate a few times I was ready to drink.<br>
<br>
S: The smell was a bit different than I normally expect for a porter. I did get a hint of roast and a bit of pecan, but there was something off in the nose. I just couldn't quite put my finger on it.<br>
<br>
T: The taste had a little roast and a touch of oak. Not getting much bourbon or pecans in the taste. There was something different with the taste. It was a bit off but I couldn't put my finger on it. It wasn't dominating, but noticeable. It stayed in the background throughout, even as the beer warmed. <br>
<br>
M: Carbonation was very high for the style and it seemed a bit thin. I got lots of prickly carbonation with each sip, from fridge temp all the way to room temp.<br>
<br>

Extremely foamy pour, off the charts :-/ Appears a little thin but mouthfeel turned out to be okay. Too tart in the nose and apparently a little funky... something is off here with weird nose and carbonation issues. Tastes fine though: chocolate, roast, and only slightly nutty if at all. In spite of the somewhat off aroma this was an enjoyable brew.<br>

A&amp;S: orange zest, hazy light orange colored beer. White head that pours about a half finger initially, but ducks down to a thin layer in a minute or so<br>
<br>
T&amp;M: super fruity, but maintains a soild hop bitterness. Pretty bitter and dry finish. <br>
<br>
Overall: Surprisingly good! Probably in the top 5 new IPA I have tried this year. I would recommend this beer but within and outside of style.

App- Black like a stout which was a welcome suprise. The beer itself pours with a nice head for a BA porter was again a good suprise. Light khaki with some spotted cling.<br>
<br>
Smell- Really came down on this one. It wasnt the most offensive smelling BA beer but had a off aroma cant place. Sticky pecans were there with some oak but overshadowed.<br>
<br>
Taste- A semi-layered BA porter. Had a ton of upfront prickly pecans with some booze notes that came off a bit more than the 8%. Was just okay.<br>
<br>
Mouth- A bit of a light body with a light-medium carbonation. A bit prickly with a lot of residual pecan flavor.<br>

Pours an opaque black with a dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, whisky, slight nuttiness, and some weird medicinal aromas. Taste is much the same with some woody flavors on the finish. This beer has a high level of carbonation that is just too much for this beer in my opinion.

<br>
A: Pours very dark brown with a huge dark brown head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Honestly it's a bit overcarbonated.<br>
<br>
S: The nose had nice notes of vanilla, cocoa, chocolate, and a touch of molasses.<br>
<br>
T: The taste is very smooth. I get vanilla, chocolate, slight molasses, and a touch of fudge. Everything has melded well over time.<br>
<br>
M: The feel is slightly on the thinner of medium with carbonation the whole way through. As it settles the carbonation settles but it started very bubbly.<br>
<br>
O: Age has toned this down and brought out more vanilla than a fresh bottle. Even though it's a bit overcarbonated that didn't detract from the overall enjoyment. We drank this next to a fresh bottle and the fresh one was overcarbonated as well and had more coffee and roasty flavors.

A mildly hazy copper with a dense, off-white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is delicious, bright and fruity with mango, peach, mandarins and a little pine. A little juicy, though there's a slightly oxidized malt character present. The palate opens with a pleasant, punchy, pungent hop character, bright and fruity with pine, mandarin, a little peach and mango. The mid-palate has plenty of juicy pine and a little honey-like sweetness present.

pours pretty black with an oversized dark chocolate head that recedes quickly, lacing pretty well.<br>

kind of an odd aroma. sweet, not too roasty, with a little bit of a nutty kick, and very little barrel character.<br>

starts boozy and hot, then sweet, but with plenty of whiskey. a bit nutty, a bit sweet. some vanilla, molasses and brown sugar.<br>
<br>
way over carbonated. I think that may be affecting the flavors, too. medium bodied with tons of prickly carbonation.<br>
<br>
I like it. but, it's just not well-executed. The bottle says they've only bottle it three times, so hopefully in future bottlings they work out these kinks. The foundation is there to make this a tremendous beer, but the final product, at this point, does not reach the levels it could.<br>
___<br>
after a few months the gushing has increased and the off-flavors have as well.<br>

Do not age this one. despite the wax... this beer will NOT improve with time and its mediocrity is best enjoyed as fresh as possible.<br>

<br>
A: Pours a deep brown with plum like edges. A thin tan head forms on the pour and leaves some splotchy lace behind.<br>
<br>
S: The initial smells are of whiskey and oak. Slightly chocolately and roasty as well. There is a more raw wood and freshy nutty taste with a little green hop presence.<br>
<br>
T: Sweet whiskey, roasted malts and oak all pop up front it. It melds to a nutty and chocolate flavors combination in the middle and the finish has a slightly fruity hop presence.<br>
<br>
M: Low carbonation with a medium body. The finish is slightly astringent but it doesn't detract from the overall feel.<br>

Pours a light, hazy orange color with a solid looking white creamy head.  Nice perlage and a good amount of white lacing persists.  <br>

Abundant aromas of orange peel, orange juice, orange pith, pine resin, grass, garden herbs, candied citrus, marshmallow, gooseberry, and subtle stone fruit.  Very vinous nose that gives and gives.<br>

Medium-full bodied with plenty of bready, malty grapefruit and citrus flavors.  At times verging on the more tropical with notes of pineapple and papaya, but truly a second fiddle to the more orange citrus notes.  <br>

750 ml black waxed bottle<br>
Served into a snifter<br>
<br>
A: High carbonation on the pour yielding a huge frothy tan head. Dark brown body, black in the glass. Lacing was good and the retention cap was thick, too.<br>
<br>
S: Roasted malts, nutty, pecans, chocolate, oak and not too much in the way of whiskey. A sweetness with a little booze could be the affects of the barrel but it doesn't stand out like other spirit barrel aged beers.<br>
<br>
T: Plenty of roasted malt, a little coffee, bitter chocolate and a lot of nuts. Not necessarily pecans per se, but a very overall nutty flavor. Back of the palate has a bit of whiskey and wood, just enough to compliment the base beer without overpowering it.<br>
<br>
M: Too carbonated for my liking. This could easily be toned back quite a bit to give it a full-body, instead this is kind of fizzy and thin.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It has plenty of different flavors that all work well with the porter base.

This looks every bit like a big stout. the thickness, the blackness, the unholyness. please stop all the madness<br>

Smells amazing. Has ""that smell"" I love in an IPA. I always describe it like candy and everyone always looks at me weird. A really colorful profile of hop aroma. 4 hop flavors isn't a crazy amount, but they work well together. There's piney, a little citrus, a little fruity. NICE! Can smell the malt! YAY! I hate when you cant smell the malt-A little toasty...<br>

4.22,54905,"Poured from a fresh 750-ml bottle of this straight out of the Twins Liquor store into a Jester King tasting tulip. I shared this with my wife who was not crazy about drinking bourbon- or whiskey-flavored beer of any type, yet she was satisfied with the outcome.<br>
<br>
A - Dark brown beer with a pretty thick tan head, up to the size of two or three fingers. It left some laces on the sides of the glass for a few minutes, however, dissolving much slower than the top brand Belgian ale ones.<br>
<br>
S - The smell of bourbon notes came up to the nostrils first pleasantly. Some sour chocolate and roasted malts blended and flowed in with the bourbon counterparts as to be nominated the best rating value of all assessments for this beer.<br>
<br>
T - Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and some pecans intertwining to make the taste fantastic. Yet, the mouth feel, described below, stripped away the potentials of this beer going prominent.<br>
<br>
M - Medium to heavy carbonation took the toll on the authenticity of this beer. It would have been handpicked amongst the cream of the crops if the body was made smooth and full. I had the inability to differentiate this much without carbonation partaking and playing a factor.<br>
<br>
O - I will drink this over and over. Perhaps, I'd leave several bottles to age over time to hopefully dilute the carbonation. I am interested to see if this is also being served on tap.<br>
<br>
Note: If you leave the bottle in the fridge a couple days after opening it, the taste and mouthfeel have improved tremendously to lessen the carbonation. The rating would have been better than 4.18 for this case.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,592 characters</span><br><br>","Apr 25, 2012",3.5,4.5,4,,5,4,GreatBloomer

3.23,45617,"Served on nitro-draught at the Crown and Anchor pub in Austin, Texas. Expectations were high given its current ratings. Reviewed from notes. <br>
<br>
A: Disappointingly, the nitro-pour doesn't yield the bubble show you'd expect in the best nitro-draught versions of the style. <br>
<br>
Pours a 1.5 finger wide head of beautifully creamy soft complexion. Gorgeous. Head is a khaki-tan colour with great milk-like thickness and supple creaminess. Lovely surface tension suspends the creaminess. Light gleams off the even head. Nice consistent lacing as the head recedes. Retention is excellent - about 7+ minutes. Damn, I do love a good nitro head. Cask ale doesn't come close. <br>
<br>
Body colour is an opaque solid black - not quite a jet black. Some cola-like carbonation bubbles line the sides. No yeast particles are visible. No vibrance (it's opaque). <br>
<br>
Sm: Cream, pecan nut, chocolate malts, dark malts, roasted grains/barley, and hazelnut. Caramelized pecan is a highlight, but boy do I wish it was more evocative and deep; it's not as prominent as it should be. A pleasant approachable aroma of mild strength.<br>
<br>
No hop character, yeast character, or alcohol is detectable. <br>
<br>
T: The creamy open gives way to a body comprised of your usual dark and chocolate malts, but it takes a turn for the better on the climax, whereupon pecan nut and a biteen of hazelnut come out to play. Some muddled caramelization. Hmm. Pecan should definitely be the star here, but it doesn't quite rise to the task. Balance is decent, but there's not much complexity here so it isn't much of a feat. Not gestalt. Not particularly subtle either.<br>
<br>
Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour. Average amplitude. I do like it for what it is. <br>
<br>
Mf: Nicely creamy, but a bit thin unfortunately. Smooth and wet - perhaps unnaturally so. It suits the flavour profile decently, but doesn't come off custom-tailored to it. Decent/adequate carbonation. Decent body. Above average execution, but there's room for improvement. <br>
<br>
Dr: Drinkable, but it didn't deliver on the potential of the premise. I'l revisit it - hopefully on-draught - but frankly I'm disappointed. It's a pretty nice little porter, but it really needs to commit more to the pecan flavour. Go big or go home. <br>

<br>
Nose is grapefruit and orange peel, and light pine hops combined with toasted malts. <br>
<br>
Taking a sip, mainly bitter grapefruit pith, with the sweeter citrus and pine fighting to come through. Mid tongue, light toasted and caramel malt sweetness through to the dry finish with lingering grapefruit. <br>

Light to medium body with gentle carbonation. Easy to drink IPA, but lacking the fruity hop flavors I enjoy.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">652 characters</span><br><br>","May 20, 2012",4,4,3.5,-11.8%,3.5,3.5,nataku00

<br>
Look: Couple fingers of head is retained nicely. Hazy gold in color. Very nice lacing. Light carbonation.<br>
<br>
Smell: A little grapefruit. Subtle piney resin. Small lemon citrus zest.<br>
<br>
Taste: Tropical fruitiness up front. Grapefruit, orange, maybe a little mango, a little lemon. Bitter finish is a little astringent.<br>
<br>
Feel: Medium to light body, watery even.  Certainly a wet finish.<br>
<br>
Overall: Meh. If I'm in serch of an InBev IPA, I'd rather go with Elysian's The Immortal. This beer looks pretty, but there isn't much to it.

A - Dark brown beer with a pretty big tan head that had some decent retention and left a bit of stick on the sides.<br>

T - It doesn't taste right. This has become infected. It's not raging yet, but it's gotten a good hold on the beer. There is some pecan and roasted malts underneath. I guess it could have been good, but unfortunately it's infected.<br>

Aroma, however, is not nearly so meager: grapefruit and rich tropical fruit smells like passionfruit and mango.  Flavor brings the hops with the same tropical fruit flavor and a healthy dose of middle-of-the-palate bitterness.  Fine carbonation.<br>

Smell - Hoppy aroma as expected, with notes of pine, citrus and pineapple. Clean malt breadiness underneath. <br>
<br>
Taste - A modestly hoppy IPA, but well tuned to create a simple harmonious buzz. Orange is at the forefront with backing notes of pineapple and a hint of grapefruit. Malts that hint at caramel, but moreso imparts a lightly toasted breadiness. Touches of mango and peach with it's stoney pit. Moderate pine and citrus pith bitterness come through near the finish, but orange sweetness is there too, delivering a balanced bittersweet aftertaste.<br>

huge tan head that crept up over the top of the glass after reaching a height of three inches. Settling down very slowly it left tons of lacing up and down the sides of the glass, thick, and coating, this one looked like a monster right off the bat. The aroma was equally as big, rich chocolate and bourbon notes slip seamlessly around a shell of molasses and baked brown sugar. Decadent and dessert like in every sense of the word and hard to envision this as anything other then a big stout. Very sip is like black gold. Rich full feel, and near perfect carbonation compliment everything so well. Chocolate and coffee notes lead the way with a rich boozy bourbon feel kicking at the back of the throat. Sweet molasses notes coming in next, just dissolving over the tongue and really pushing the envelope on the flavor. Touches of licorice and a moderately dry finish smooth it out very well, while nearly all the ABV is well masked behind huge flavor.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">990 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 12, 2011",4.5,4.5,4.5,,4.5,4.5,mikesgroove

mouth is definitely overcarbonated... maybe a bit shook up via fedex, but still... with the hot carbonation, it made the alcohol a bit hot and really accentuated the peppery, hoppy notes of the brew.

Very dark brown beer, with the dim lighting, it was pretty much black. Thinner head than I was hoping for, but retention was good.<br>

Bourbon smell gets in your face and I love it. After the bourbon, this definitely reminds me more of a stout, but I suppose the line between double porter and stout is blurry.<br>

Again, the bourbon is right there and I love it. Not harsh or overdone, but it will be interesting to see how much this fades with age. I get a bit of coffee here that I did not get in the smell, blame the bourbon. The underlying beer has good depth of flavor, and the finish balances out the bourbon nicely.<br>

Had this on tap 3-08-11 at The Ginger Man(FW) for their ""Logo Pint Night"", so picked up two free (512) pint glasses to boot.<br>
<br>
Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color, with a very minimal tan head that still left behind some nice lacing. *The lighting at the pub was not the best so I had to work with the little I had available.<br>
<br>
I got an initial smell of bourbon with some oaky-ness from the barrel aging, and later on picked up on some nice roasted malts and a definate coffee presence. Not too overpowering in the aroma, but a nice in-between balance.<br>
<br>
The taste was very similar to the smell, with an actual hint of roasted pecan. Very up front malty sweetness, and there was absolutely no denying the bourbon presence here. Little to no hop characteristics which are abit more present in other porters including (512)'s standard PP. Very enjoyable all around taste.<br>
<br>
Very smooth, medium to heavy body(but not overly syrupy) with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Although an obvious whiskey presence, the alcohol was not at all overpowering, but left a ""warm"", soothing feeling. Slight whiskey aftertaste.<br>

Overall, this was a very enjoyable aged Double Porter, that I will have no problem going back to again.

Mouthfeel: Beautifully effervescent, a well balanced beer, not too weighty and not at all thin. <br>
<br>
Overall: Perfect. If only they made a session version which I could drink all day. My standby beer at bars around town. I have been drinking this since it first hit the taps and am not tiring of it whatsoever.

<br>
It looks about like the 512 Pecan Porter I had on tap a couple nights ago, dark brown and opaque with a mocha colored foam, less lacing than the standard Pecan Porter but maybe due to glass handling at a different location.<br>
<br>
The whiskey is a little subdued in the aroma, getting just a little stronger as it warmed. A lot of the cocoa character I liked in the original, this smells pretty massive, more stout-y than porter-y. <br>
<br>
A little hot tasting, maybe a hint of cough medicine too, where did that come from? These off-notes are slight and probably nitpicky on my part, the underlying beer is quite good. I think this might be one of those occasions where I prefer the beer without a barrel treatment. 512 Pecan Porter is so good on its own, the whiskey barrel doesn't seem to improve it much at all. Maybe makes it a tad worse, meaning it's still a good beer but not where it could be. <br>

This is not the beer I remember a year ago. <br>
A: This pours the same with a small bubbly tan head that quickly fades. <br>
S: The aroma is of whiskey barrels and alcohol. Some burnt toasted malt. Bitter and acrid. <br>
T: The flavor is incredibly hot. Lots of nondescript bourbon/alcohol flavors going on. Sweet malt, char, and wood that finishes acrid and bitter. Not much of any stout here. Mostly barrel. There is a certain sourness here as well. It is not pronounced, but always in the background. Kind of odd.<br>
M/D: This is really thin and watery. Not easy to drink at all. It was a chore to finish my glass.<br>

This is overwhelmingly whiskey/alcoholic/barrel. There is also some notes of sourness, probably not from infection, but it is there on the newer release.

4.57,54905,"(512) Bourbon-Barrel Aged Double Pecan Porter<br>
Served from a cask at The Dig Pub and poured into a pint glass <br>
<br>
A: Beautiful beer that poured black into the (512) glass that I got to take home with me. Thanks Dig Pub! There was no head present when delivered to our table, just a little lacing at the top of the glass.<br>
<br>
S: I noticed the smell of the Jack Daniels bourbon right away. I also noticed the aroma of the roasted malts, coffee and chocolate.<br>
<br>
T: The taste of the bourbon barrel aging is the first thing that you notice, followed by the roasted malts. The variety of all of the various flavors work well with each other and nothing dominates.<br>
<br>
M: Coming out of a cask, the mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with very little carbonization present. I will have to search out more cask events.<br>
<br>
D: Aging in the Jack Daniel's barrel was a great idea that made a great beer even better. Putting the beer in a cask helped make a very complex beer even more drinkable.<br>
<br>
Wish that I could have had another pint but this was another great event at Dig Pub and there was only enough in the cask for everybody to have one. I hear that they are working on aging a batch in Maker's Mark barrels. A great reason that 2011 should be another great year for beer lovers in Austin.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,271 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 02, 2011",4.5,4,5,,4.5,4.5,rissues24
3.76,54905,"Served on cask at the Draught House in a nonic half pint glass.<br>
<br>
Had to make it out to the Draught House for this unique offering. Brought along a bunch of other Chem E's with me to try it out.<br>
<br>
The beer poured a dark brown with a creamy one finger tan head. Nicely composed beer. Wish the lighting would have been better for me to appreciate it a bit more.<br>
<br>
The aroma was pure barrel. I wanted to get some of the malty and nutty notes out of it, but it was just an overpowering vanilla. Not a bad nose, but definitely one dimensional.<br>
<br>
The taste was also overwhelmed by e barrel. To me, it seemed sweet and vanilla. Even though it was a double pecan porter, I couldn't get the wonderful nutty and roasted tastes from the standard (512) offering (which I had on hand for a comparison). Other people described it as a pure whiskey taste, a mixture of 75% beer and 25% whiskey or like drinking a barrel. There was no subtlety to this beer.<br>
<br>
For how barrel-dominated the flavor was, this beer had a great mouthfeel. One person at the table described it as round, which I thi is an excellent way to put it. Smetimes the regular pecan porter can come across as watery, but this had an excellent weight. I would love to have some non barrel aged double pecan porter. I bet that beer would put me on cloud 9.<br>
<br>
Overall, this was an interesting experience that I was glad to share with some friends, but I feel like the barrel aging could have been better executed. If they would have blended this beer with some unaged double pecan, I think I would have loved this beer to no end. *sigh*<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,579 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 16, 2010",4.5,4.5,4,-9.2%,3.5,3.5,UTCengOwl

<br>
Appearance - Pours slightly hazy and light golden orange in color with an off-white finger width head. Good retention, giving way to a thin, silky layer of surface suds. A strong pattern of lace is left on the glass with excellent stick.<br>
<br>
Smell - Orange and pineapple with a hint of mango.<br>
<br>
Taste - Follows the nose. Bright, tropical hop notes that touch on pineapple and orange, with a ghostly trace of mango. Not much in the way of malt, but what is there comes off as a bit grainy.  Lightly bitter in the finish with citrus pith lingering in the aftertaste. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with soft, bubbly carbonation and a semi-dry finish.<br>
<br>
Overall - Nice, drinkable brew, though doesn't do much to stand out from the rush of Mosaic inspired IPAs that have hit the market.

A: We've got a gusher! Huge tan head that finally subsides to the point where you can drink the dark brown liquid that lies beneath.<br>
<br>
S: A bit of nuttiness to the nose along with a very noticeable acidity. Light chocolate and really no barrel/whiskey character at all--not surprising due to the infection.<br>
<br>
T: Luckily the flavor is not completely overwhelmed by the infection, and there is a bit of vanilla and pecan, but it is subtle and muddled. Definitely some lactic notes, though.<br>
<br>
M: The body is medium and obviously very overcarbonated. Again, a product of the infection.<br>

A pretty rich orange/copper beer, served in a chilled (i didn't have the heart to send it back as the place was starting to get crowded for the Harry Potter movie) pint glass. Not much head, but a sustained ring lasted for the duration.<br>
<br>
MMM...smelled really good. Tropical fruit right off the bat (mango, pineapple)..some resinous pine and a touch of sweet malt as well.<br>
<br>
Taste followed smell...the initial mango topped off with pine on the backend...a decent amount of malt to even it out...but a definite hop smack to the pallate. Very refreshing.<br>
<br>
Super crisp, sharp carbonation...I did not want to drink it quickly, but i kept finding myself reaching for the glass a bit faster after every sip..a true sign of a good, drinkable beer. The 7% is well hidden, can easily sneak up on you if you thrown back a couple too quickly.<br>

4.25,54905,"Bottle supplied by thickerfreakness for the Rate Beer Winter Gathering - thanks for sending this one to Orlando for us. Served in a tulip-style taster glass.<br>
<br>
A - Pretty nice pillow-like tan foam for the smallish glass. It eventually dissipates to a ring and some haze, and lives a bit of spotty lacing. The body is a very, very, dark opaque brown.<br>
<br>
S - Coffee, vanilla, nuts, light oak and whiskey, and some chocolate. It smells exactly like the name suggests - and that's a good thing! Excellent balance and integration, and not obvious alcohol.<br>
<br>
T - Roasty bitterness, coffee, chocolate, nuts, oaky vanilla, and a touch of smoke and whiskey. Again, this is really understated from the Jack Daniels angle - kind of like Blackbeerd. Thankfully it's saved by a really excellent base beer that benefits from a touch of whiskey bite. It's closer to a 4.25 so I was a little hard on the appearance.<br>
<br>
M - Thin, a touch gritty, moderate carbonation. It's clearly a porter from the texture, but it could benefit from a bit more heft to support the intense flavor and higher ABV.<br>
<br>
D - Very drinkable - I'd be happy having a bottle of this one to myself. Too bad it's so limited and tough to get.

Appearance: Copper-orange with a fluffy white head that fades into a lacing on the top of the beer. <br>

Aroma: Citrusy and floral, but dominated by the unmistakable aroma that is grapefruit. Just not complex enough for me.<br>

Mouthfeel: On the higher end of carbonation, but a nice dry finish and a lingering bitterness.<br>

4.4,54905,"I have had excellent experiences with 512 in the past, and my expectations were very high. Unfortunately I received a short pull from the tap, but my disappointment in my portion size soon dissipated after my first look/sip. <br>
<br>
Beautiful opaque black color and a small, tan, cool-whip-like head. Laced extensively. <br>
<br>
Initially it smelled like whiskey and molasses. As it warmed up more toffee notes appeared. I noted an almost anise-like aroma at times. <br>
<br>
Taste is a huge whiskey/molasses 1-2 punch. Layers appear after repeated sips. Definitely toffee, as in the nose, but more nuttiness than I expected. The barrel is pronounced through out the beer, but never overpowering. The flavors are intertwined delicately. I could pick each one out initially, and then put them back togthter as I swallowed. <br>
<br>
Not too thick on the mouthfeel. Near perfect balance of weight and brightness. It never became too heavy or tiresome. Tough to call it an easy drinker though. Too big for more than one at a time. <br>
<br>
I must say that I can't see calling this a porter, or even a double porter. It's more IRS-like, but without the oiliness and weight.

A - Opaque, near-black, iced espresso color. No head, but a small latte colored ring of foam. Little lacing. Leaves a syrupy coating on the glass when swirled.<br>

S - Whiskey dominates the nose, adding vanilla sweetness to the underlying roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate aromas.<br>

T - There are many flavors and they all taste good. They don't overpower each other; they flow in balanced succession. Roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Nutty undertones throughout.

The nose is an hebal citrus and sweet malt. A clean crisp smelling IPA that is nothing special but does have a solid scent. It does dip into a little mustiness but very minimally. <br>

Taste is nicely hopped right from the get go. A citrus flavor burst followed by a slightly toasted sweet malt. The musty scent isn't carried over to the taste which is a bonus. The carbonation and hops make a nice acidic wash that really compliments the style. <br>

That bitterness really finishes the beer well giving you a nice pucker after each sip. It has a little creaminess that really gives this one some nice body and balance with a carbonatied sizzle.

4.15,54905,"Poured into a snifter at the Austin Flying Saucer New Year's Eve Party. Happy 2010!!!<br>
<br>
The bigger, badder whiskey-barrel-aged Double Pecan Porter looks a lot like the original, with a dark, opaque body the color of the Austin night I'm celebrating. The head is equally as attractive, with a reddish, dark custard hue and creamy consistency. Not the best retention or lacing, but the foam is easily revived by a quick swirl of the snifter. The aroma is as big as the name suggests--whiskey-laden with a warmth of booze and charred wood. Coffee and macadamia nut in the background, with toasted dark chocolate malts laying down a solid backbone.<br>
<br>
No doubt this is a good beer, but the barrel-aging did little to improve upon the original Pecan Porter flavor in my opinion. A slight whiskey warmth adds some spice and breathy alcohol, while the rest of the palate picks up chocolate and coffee maltiness and some earthy hops. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, with a low carbonation level and semi-boozy finish. Easy to drink, and easy to get carried away with if you neglect the 8.8%(?) ABV. I had to keep reminding myself that this was an imperial porter, not a stout, and in that respect it certainly succeeds. Perhaps a bit over-hyped, but a very good beer nevertheless.

It pours every bit as dark as the regular porter, with that familiar coffee-coloured head that lasts and lasts, but when you raise the glass to your nose there's a familiar whiff of vanilla that you get from an oak barrel, along with more than a hint of the whiskey that was once in it. The pecans are slightly overpowered in this brew but that's not something to mark it down for - it's still one of the best porters I've tasted. There's a wonderfully dry, bitter finish to the brew.

I am writing this from München, while drinking a great Andechs Dopplebock Dunkel, and all I can say is I miss this beer. I am IPA biased so take this in consideration. This beer has the right combination of citrusy hoppiness and aroma. Most drinkable beer I have tasted (again for my taste).

I'm glad my friend was talkative and wasn't able to down her entire beer. This allowed me to pour some of hers into my glass and see what the head looks like. Big, beautiful creamy white that doesn't go away. I need better pours when I go out... The beer itself was a clear, dark yellow with a few red shades. Looks like tastiness.<br>

I rarely can smell beers that well unless they're in my snifter. What I remember here is hops. Glorious citrus and piney hops.<br>
<br>
This beer is like drinking grapefruit juice... and in a good way. Holy hell, there are a ton of hops in here. The one problem I have with this beer is that I had to chug a glass of it on my birthday... and that was pretty rough. Definitely lowers the drinkability, but it's not like that's the beer's strong point anyway. The malt backbone is solid, if unmemorable. The bitterness isn't overpowering. The mouthfeel is solid.

@TheGingerMan<br>
Plano, TX<br>
<br>
App- Black like a stout which was a welcome suprise. The beer itself pours with a nice head for a porter was again a good suprise. Light khaki with some spotted cling.<br>
<br>
Smell- Really a nice aromatic porter. The base malts are hidden and the pecan really comes through with a bit of cream behind it. The malts are hidden but still there is more of a correct statement.<br>
<br>
Taste- A semi-layered porter. Had a ton of upfront pecans with some creamy malty notes that came off a bit more than the 8%. Was a tasty porter and nicely balanced without being cloying.<br>
<br>
Mouth- A bit of a light body with a light-medium carbonation. A bit smooth with a lot of residual pecan flavor.<br>
<br>
Drink- I really enjoyed this one. Much better than the base beer was. I'd like a couple bottles of this.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">834 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 19, 2013",3.75,3.5,3.75,-8.2%,4,3.75,FosterJM

A growler shared by womencantsail, thanks Andrew. My notes are brief on this one as I was reviewing on my phone with the glass in my other hand while trying to juggle and talk at the same time. The beer appears dark amber with a frothy white head. The aroma is completely unlike a San Diego IPA, but nice nonetheless. It's well balanced, exhibiting notes of rich and sugary caramel malt alongside aromatic grapefruit and pine. You can tell this is pretty damn fresh. The flavor displays the same balance between hops and malt, with sweet caramel malt, pine resin, and sugary grapefruit with a touch of orange pith. The mouthfeel is sticky and fairly dry.

4.12,43535,"I had this at a beer tasting event at the 512 brewery a couple of weeks ago. After waiting in line in 95 degree heat for an hour, this brew was PURE. BLISS. Pour was subpar (barely any head) as the servers were zooming around trying to keep everyone's glasses full. There was still a bit of lacing down the glass though. The beer was amber in color with a nose of grapefruit and moderate hops. It had a medium body with smooth carbonation. Prominent flavors are grapefruit and hops up front, fading to a warm maltiness and moderate bitterness lingering on the palate. Hops are definitely there, but not overdone. In my opinion, this was a perfectly balanced IPA. <br>

Beautiful IPA, this. Tangerine copper hue seems a bit dark for the style, but the creamy taupe head is gorgeous and goes nowhere. Best lacing I've seen in a while, coating the inside of the pint with a continuous, thick layer of foam. Aroma is equally as impressive, with sweet tropical fruits that suggest mango, pineapple, and orange peel. The hops add notes of pine and resin, while the maltiness is biscuity and caramel-rich.<br>
<br>
Aggressive restraint to the hops, which hit the palate with a leafy, piny bitterness and grapefruit flesh. Lots of fruitiness too, as per the aroma, but the taste is another dimension of hoppiness (in a very good way). Malts are a bit simplistic, but that's an easy facet to overlook given the plethora of greenness coating the palate. Good body, with a medium-light consistency and a crisp, juicy carbonation level. (512)'s IPA paired nicely with my chimichanga.

Nose is nicely hoppy - very uber-American - citric, pine, pungent... almost body odor strength pungency... and spicy hot. Smells heavenly.<br>

Pours dark yellow / pale amber with moderate clarity. Nice head. Looks good.<br>

The hops plunge into a soft foamy sea of malt - creamy, sweet, and toasty/biscuit. Nice hands-off bitterness via hop. Clean hop flavor, amazingly clean for the strength of hop. Also amazing is the balance. Lots of hops, but the malt steps up to take it. Great mouthfeel. Tart and quenchingly sour. Slightly oily. Hop flavor follows nose and is more restrained and less pungent/sharp. Tastes great. Feels great. Great drinkability.<br>

4,43535,"On tap at the Flying Saucer in Austin. Suggested by MiguelMandingo. Great choice! <br>
<br>
A: Pours a hazy amber color that leans toward coppery. Two fingers of creamy bubbles form a great head on the beer, which retains well and leaves some lacing down the sides. <br>
<br>
S: Having cut my teeth on West Coast IPAs, I'm enthused to smell something different. It's still citrus-forward, in grapefruit, apricot, and orange rind varieties; but unlike WCIPAs, it has a substantial earthy and grassy aroma beneath. Normally I don't like that, but the overall effect is like smelling a freshly mowed garden, and it's mouth-watering. Definitely some caramel and bread in there, as well. <br>

This IPA was served a pretty hazy orange color with a good two fingers of white head. Expecting loads of hops, I was immediately surprised by the out-and-out fruitiness in both the nose and taste. I'd compare the fruit taste to the ""passionfruit"" flavor I've tasted in green teas, juices, etc. Also tasted a floral note in the beer, which had me thinking rose hips, somehow.

S: Chocolatey sweetness and nuttiness, solid roasted malt backbone shows a light dusting of coffee aromas. Maybe a hint of dark caramel or molasses...<br>

Smell - This is a pretty interesting smelling IPA - fruity and hoppy. Citrusy and apricot-y. Grassy and herbal hops. Caramel and toffee malt build. Definitely stands out as a Texas IPA.<br>

<br>
Poured a slightly hazy golden shade of amber, with a good sized, creamy off-white head that receded after a few minutes and left spotty lace.<br>
<br>
Piney and citrusy in the nose, in that order. <br>
<br>
Pine sap and slightly sweet citrus fruit hit the tastebuds at pretty much the same time. Then there’s what seems to me to be a slight bit of malt flavor that’s not unlike toasted bread, with a tart, grapefruity bitterness that increases until it takes over and finishes out the taste.<br>
<br>
Prickly, resiny mouthfeel.<br>
<br>
A little bit different, The bitterness sort of sneaks up on you. I like how there’s quite a bit of citrusy flavor without it seeming like a glass of alcoholic fruit juice.

4.04,53808,"You know that amber/golden colour we all like in BEER, and especially IPAs? That's this one. It's a bit opaque, and has a more yellow than amber hue. Big white head with good retention and lacing.<br>
<br>
The nose is fresh and spicy. There's some nectarine-juiciness that permeates before giving way to a distinct apricot sweetness. Sweet citrus and tropical fruits. Manages to be juicy without the thick sticky sweetness which usually accompanies that (I actually like that thick sweetness, but that's neither here nor there.). <br>
<br>
Comes through with much of the same characteristic as the nose: primarily sweet fruits and citrus, though the sweet juiciness gives way to a thinner, colder bitterness. Enough of a malt backbone that it supports the hops running around willy nilly, but no more. Honestly, if I didn't know it was there because of the body support I couldn't pick out much malt at all. Finish takes the theme of juicy fruits tending towards the bitter and runs full tilt into the bitter end. Decent body, carbonation supports but doesn't distract, this is a bit of a pleasant surprise as I picked it up essentially on a whim since I needed something for NBS. <br>
No freshness date (grr! scowl!), but based simply on taste I would imagine it's pretty fresh. Definitely enjoying this one.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,289 characters</span><br><br>","Aug 10, 2014",3.75,4,4,,4.25,4,kemoarps

4,45617,"On-tap at Deep-Ellum for their Texas Beer Takeover event for the release party of Brash's The Bollocks. Served in a pint glass.<br>

A- An opaque jet-black with about a finger of light creamy slightly bubbly mocha brown head that has good retention, but dissipates slowly. Some spotty mocha lacing. About average carbonation.<br>
<br>
S- Pecans, dark chocolate, light roasted malts, some espresso, about average aroma strength. <br>

O- This was a very nice porter that I'm glad I got the chance to try on-tap (first time it's been served in MA). It had a nice pecan taste balanced with chocolate malts with an excellent drink-ability. Definitely not nearly as good as other porters I've had such as Founders and HF Everett.

4.08,170128,"Bright golden honey peach tone orangey color with minimal but lacy foam. Peach on the nose as well hay honeysuckle apple, it's very tart tasting that balances out the hops and complements the mouthfeel is a pleasantly puckersome way. It certainly makes an impact on first sip and has bright Amarillo and fruity Mosaic and the solid Simcoe and it works. It's delicious! Lucky me for buying the 12 variety pack, which also had Apocalypse, Easy Black IPA, and s1nist0r Black Ale, as my introduction to this brewery. Since getting to Oregon, I seem to be buying mostly Bend breweries. Got to go visit there.<br>
edit: having another one two days later, a sip from the bottle yields a massive grapefruit flavor, but it's blended in with the malt after pouring into a glass and it's more of a rounded flavor, just in case anyone is going through their reactionary anti-grapefruit phase.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">876 characters</span><br><br>","May 02, 2015",3.75,4.25,4.25,,3.75,4.25,trentbent

4.3,170128,"This brew came in a very affordable $14 mixed 12 pack of 10 Barrel.<br>
<br>
In contrast to most ""pale"" IPAs, this brew actually is pale golden in color, with slight haziness and a nice head that leaves behind some lace.<br>
<br>
I noticed a strong whiff of grapefruit-mandarin-citrus-hops as I poured it, some of my favorite aromas from a beer.  Definitely on the tropical/nectar side of the hop aromas, and it's hard to detect any malts.  Not only great aromas but great intensity help boost the score for me.<br>
<br>
Flavor is hop-forward but not much bitterness, with light and mellow maltiness.  Medium carbonation plays well with the happiness, and this beer has a pretty long, slick finish.<br>
<br>
Overall, another fantastic IPA from 10 Barrel.  I wasn't impressed with their winter warmer, but their IPAs stand out among the crowded grocery aisle as some of the best easily-found IPAs here in Oregon.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">879 characters</span><br><br>","May 01, 2015",4.25,4,4.25,,4.5,4.25,josiahschlender

3.88,45617,"On tap into a pint glass at the Flying Saucer in Rockwall, TX<br>
<br>
A - very dark brown/black with medium-tan foam. Not much head on the unseen pour and what is there vanishes immediately with virtually no lacing.<br>
<br>
S - Faint hints of char, sweetness but try as I might, I could not pick up in pecans or nutty aromas. Solid nose on this beer, just didnt meet my expectations.<br>
<br>
T - almost all the taste is on the front side of the drink. Matches the nose closely but finally able to detect sublte nuttiness. Again, would have liked more pecan to help distinguish it from several other quality American porters. To me, this style is lacking when brewers dont add unusual (for porters) flavor. Solid flavor for the style tho, thus the score.<br>
<br>
M - Like a good porter should, coats the mouth briefly and finishes clean...cleaner than a majority of the ones I have had recently actually. Well done here.<br>
<br>
O - Not too overwhelmed by my first (512) brew sadly. I am sure their whales have more character but I was just (perhaps unjustly) hoping for more. However, this is a really good example of the style and I would reach for it over a majority of other American porters if it had ANY distribution near me.

4.5,45617,"This pours the color of smoke and char, topped by a foamy head the color of cocoa. Full of all sorts of roast aroma, and just a touch of mellow maltiness to round it out. You don’t taste the pecans until you start to sip, and even then it’s not as apparent as you might think. The pecans play a role, as the name implies, but it’s in conjunction with a lot of roasty coffee, some dark chocolate, and a touch of hoppy bitterness to keep it engaging. Seriously folks, this is one of my favorite porters. I had it at the tail end of its release last year and I’m glad I’ve been in Texas long enough to try it fresh this year. Look for it on hand pump—it's also an amazing candidate for cask conditioning.<br>
<br>
[9/11 review] Had on cask at the Draughthouse in Austin. They have such a limited distribution for this that I'll take it when I can get it.<br>
<br>
Served in a nonick pint glass. Pours a delicious black with a good amount of head. Great carbonation, strong roasty aroma and dark coffee in the nose. Great body, and on cask it works so well that i might *might* not be able to drink it on tap again. I kid, I kid. But on cask, wow! Needless to say, tastes fantastic. Smooth oily mouthfeel, sharp roastiness, some coffee. I don’t taste the pecans at first but the smoothness and residual sweetness is there as it warms. Definitely reminds me of a pecan coffee, where there’s a balance of sweet &amp; savory through the roast. This is a seasonal that has a limited distribution and I wish they’d bottle it so i could take it with me.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,541 characters</span><br><br>","Dec 17, 2011",4.5,4.5,4.5,,4.5,4.5,elNopalero

T: Big bold grain and malt flavors up front. Rich leather, a bit of tobacco with English black tea. Big bright hops finish the the beer in a greasy wet chlorophyll taste. The finish has a fascinating tiny cinnamon spice finish paired with a little orange peel.<br>
<br>
M: Medium body. Not too heavy and syrupy. A little long on the finish with a lingering brown sugar and barley taste. A little dry on the finish but not too bad.<br>
<br>
O: Really fascinating IPA. Not many IPAs carry so much malt. Yet, despite the big grain forward flavor, the IPA portion is not diminished. True to the style, the hops carry through and shine in this one. Really big and a slow drinker, but definitely better tasting than it looks.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,083 characters</span><br><br>","Mar 13, 2014",3.75,2.5,3.75,-2.1%,3.75,4,constantine_272

<br>
A: Light amber, hazy, with 1-2 fingers of white tightly bubbled head with good retention and a few scraps of lace.<br>
<br>
S: Equal parts medium caramel malt and citrus hops. No alcohol in the nose. Hop notes include pine, resin, floral, orange and grapefruit citrus, and honeysuckle.<br>
<br>
T: The flavor is more hoppy than malty, but this still fits as a ""balanced"" IPA, probably still with a bit too much caramel malt character. The malt profile is mostly medium caramel with a little toffee note followed by sneaky strong pine, grapefruit, resin, and floral hop flavors. I do not get any alcohol or yeast character. I wish the caramel malt would be dialed down about 50% by Lovibond to lighter crystal with no Victory -- it is too much and blunts the varied and moderately bitter hoppiness.<br>
<br>
M: Fairly slick and medium bodied with even mid-range carbonation.<br>
<br>
O: A good but undistinguished IPA. More malt than I would expect from a NW IPA.

3.76,53808,"This IPA pours to a little darker tan hue than other IPA and features a nose that is big on citrus, namely orange and grapefruit. The off- white foam looks nice and leaves behind plenty of lacing. The body is slightly hazy and carbonation is moderate.<br>
<br>
Flavor- wise, this is a nice IPA with a fresh taste of citrus hops and a backbone of pale, bready malts. Other noticeable flavors include floral, pine, toasted malts, caramel, and tropical fruits. The beer is cleaner/smoother than other IPA and is more easily drinkable while still maintaining a good deal of body.<br>
<br>
This is a very good, everyday type of IPA and one I am glad I had the opportunity to sample, thanks to a beer of the month club. It isn’t extreme, but it isn’t a lightweight brew either. The brewers went for the middle ground here and they nailed it. If this was more readily available where I live, I would likely buy it and keep it around as a regular IPA in my rotation. As it stands, I have to accept that I won’t find this beer again unless I venture west, which I just might have to do so I can get my hands on more.

Thanks to Beerwolf77 for sharing this growler. Or as my soon-to-be uncle-in-law calls it despite my constant reminders, ""grobbler"".<br>

A - The hiss from the screw cap signals carbonation! Short-lived cascading ends up with a low tan head with little retention / lace. The porter is almost fully black.<br>

S - Abounding roasted chocolate malt gives this a great base! Big nuttiness compliments the chocolate roast well. A great earthy hop balance is an awesome addition.<br>

Aroma: Strong notes of caramel and chocolate however i didn't pick up on the pecan that's been so often mentioned of the smell, there was some faint nuttiness but nothing could be deciphered in particular <br>

Taste: The Pecan flavor does come out in the flavor however it plays second fiddle to the strong flavor of chocolate and some coffee notes as well.

No ""yeasty"" flavor found. very light bittering on the tail end of the drink. overall a very delicious beer<br>

On tasting I get lots of cocoa flavors, very rich, with a little pecan in the aftertaste that I sure wouldn't guess at without first knowing it was there. It's more sweet than bitter.

<br>
A vigorous pour yields a finger of soapy khaki/earth-yellow foam which slowly recedes to a thin puffy cap, partially obscuring the seal brown liquid. Basically opaque, though at certain angles there are faint tawny highlights suggesting a fine clarity. Decent retention, anaemic mottled lacing, fine glassy legs. <br>
<br>
Pecan pie, gingerbread, spice cake, toasted oats, light-roast coffee (from malt), cracked pepper, and very light grassy hop notes in the nose. Perhaps a little chocolate (or other specialty) malt?<br>
<br>
Mild roast malt on the palate - toasted nuts (only slowly discernable as pecans), biscotti, brown bread, and a low bitterness lead into the finish which is faintly smokey but otherwise clean and slightly dry and toasty. Delicate profile, but well put together. <br>
<br>
Thin bodied, and just sufficient carbonation, but I suspect the growler is at fault much more than the beer. <br>
<br>
Quite sessionable, this unique ale seems more of a Southern take on a traditional brown porter (as opposed to the more common robust porters available in the U.S.) - very pleased to get to sample this finally.

This beer pours a wonderful black with an inviting brown head. I love seeing this in pitchers at the Posse, because I know it's the best beer they carry. I guess looking at this thing reminds me of all the good times I've had with it... and that of course means extra points.<br>

The nose tonight is powerful and intoxicating. Nutty and roasty, it's easy to see why it's called a Pecan Porter.<br>

Pours a nice quickly rising almost 2 finger foamy slightly creamy head that fades at a slower pace, leaving decent soapy lacing, over a crystal clear cider tan colored beer.<br>
<br>
Nose is very aromatic, from the pop of the cap and almost explosive on the pour, lots of fresh hops, like hops sitting in the kettle perhaps a wet hop addition, with nice citrus components, little candied orange peel, nice floral notes, a little pine and resin as well, notes of tangerine and stone fruit as well, maybe a touch of papaya too. Under that is a mild candy malt, a little fresh aromatic malt character too. The longer I nose the more it turns to fresh hop cones with little pine and resin and mostly orange peel.<br>
<br>
Taste starts with more hops again, and a ton of bitterness, bit spicy hop bitterness and very chewy, like chewing on hop pellets. The bitterness is almost hammering, the 80IBU range. Into citrus, again the tangerine like citrus, as well as orange peel both fresh and candied, with orange juice packet spritz, as well as a little pith. There is a bit of pine and resin again, not much of either but enough, with again that hop cone character like fresh hop cones almost as if I'm chewing on them. There are hints of fruit too, stone fruit with a little fleshy tropical fruit like a papaya. Under all that is quite a bit of malt to back up the big hop bitterness, little candy malt with hint of reddish malt but not much, fair sweetness that makes my taste buds want to thing this is 9% but the lack of alcohol response pushes that thought back. Finish is long and very bitter, as the hops dry it gets even more bitter, and a long bitter hoppy finish that seems to last forever, little pine and resin, more citrus fruit, and a little sticky malt.<br>

Mouth is med to a bit fuller bod, a bit heavy and almost sticky syrupy but not quite there, wants to seem like it has booze warmth but there is just a touch, and nice carb.<br>

Overall not bad, a cross between west coast and east coast contemporary styles, but it's own beast at the same time. Big bitterness with decent malty sweet balance, a big beer overall with nice hops.

A- Dark brown, with little to no visibility when held to the light<br>

S- roasted malts, a little bit of coffee, not as much pecans on the nose end when compared to taste.<br>
<br>
T- This is a very tasty brew. Upfront tastes of roasted malts with a bit of mollasses or brown sugar. Finishes pretty dry, with a definate pecan aftertaste. <br>

I'd say this was the best tasting porter I've ever tried to date. Simple and straight forward, this beer doesn't over complicate things and pecans seem to compliment the style perfectly.

(note: when i took the growler out from the box it was shipped in, it was warm. i barely touched cap, but out from the electric tape around the cap soon ""growled"" out a huge hiss of carbonation, and a gushing leak of foam came out too. i immediately tried to screw it on harder and rushed to the fridge. meanwhile i had to clean up a caramel/pecan mess in the basement...)<br>

tasted in mid-may, same day of shipment.<br>

nearly opaque black. trace rays of light make it through the edges in a red/brown tint. 2-finger brown head fades to wispy layer and creamy, foamy ring. some thin rings of splotchy lace, but tend to shrink or slide back down.<br>
<br>
aroma: dark caramel, vanilla, hint of roast and coffee, and yes - some nutty pecans, almost ""creamy"" in the nose. earthy tones. not the most fragrant, even at cellar temp, but interesting and well harmonized.<br>
<br>
taste: dark malts with caramel note, leaning more towards roast, esp in finish. but light and classically porter-like. roast and coffee tones meld with moderately earthy hop bitterness, light mash acidity, and then the nutty, creamy pecan notes with faint vanilla come in. slight hints of phenols and alcohol. roast and coffee in the aftertaste too, with lingering hints of nutty pecans.<br>
<br>
medium body, smooth and creamy at times. some coffee astringency in the finish. mildly tingly carbonation, helping with creaminess.<br>

drinkability takes a SLIGHT hit, in that the something in the flavor (the sweetness of the malts? the pecans?) starts to get in the way. plus, it's very filling (and high ABV) for a porter.<br>

Taste is not heavy like some porters but is rather refreshing with enough stickiness for a porter, nice soft carbonation, sometimes porters can be a bit too assertive in that aspect, still has that weird metallic feel to it though but unlike in the aroma it's hardly a distraction, the nuttiness comes through a bit better but not nearly enough.<br>

Deep and dark with a solid maple walnut head and sparse lacing. Quite opaque - a little on the dark side, even for the style.<br>

Nice sniff of roasted coffee - mild and very creamy pecans abound as well, but in subtlety. Solid hop presence - a little pine and grass together. Coffee balances out with deep dark roasted malt. Quite velvety.<br>

Excellent balance in this - pecans provide a mild nuttiness and maybe a pinch of salt. Coffee grounds and some bittersweet chocolate notes with no hint of alcohol. Nicely done.<br>

Appearance: Pours a thick, inky brown body, capped by one-finger of tan head, bubbly, foamy, and even-looking, with average retention. While the head doesn't stick around for too long, the collar is thick, foamy, and pervasive, and the lacing - though not sheet-like or too sticky - is glittery, blobby, erratic.<br>
<br>
Aroma: Surprisingly roasty - heavily so, in fact, almost smoky in places - with tons of toast, earthy smokiness, slight dirt, and, surprisingly, only a faint nuttiness, and not overwhelmingly pecanny in nature. It's about equal parts pecans, walnuts, and almonds, just very ""generically"" nutty. It's pleasant, authentic, and well-integrated, though.<br>
<br>
Taste: Very nice, and very ""porterish."" Heavily toasted malts, faint bitter chocolate, earthy, dirty malts, faint smoke, and a nice solid nuttiness throughout, which augments the sweetness as it comes through. It tastes a little more like pecan in the mouth than it smelled like in the nose, and its presence evokes a few other notes - something like dark molasses, though that may be too many nights at Waffle House as a Georgia boy comin' through. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel: Incredibly even in a medium body, slightly creamy but still crisp, lightly milky. Very nice for the style, and very nice with the flavor profile.<br>

Drinkability: A really solid, drinkable, low abv% straightforward brew, perfectly pleasant. Really glad to have tried this one, and it makes me wish I lived in Texas - this is the sort of beer I could have half a dozen pints of with friends over the bar on a crisp autumn day.

The pour was very nice, deep, dark brown in color with a rich look to it. Some light hints of a reddish note poking through on the sides and the bottom of the glass. Nice touches of fine off white head forming on the top, nothing extreme though, maybe a half an inch or so. This faded down gracefully and left behind just a touch of lace on the edges of the glass. <br>

The aroma was very nice and quite sweet as well. Rich notes of caramel, nuts, and a hint of brown sugar all playing very nicely. As it warmed up some hints of an earthy hop note started to take shape, as well as a nice underlying layer of grain. The flavor was just really top notch here. Rich and vibrant and amazingly complex. Starting with a wave of smooth caramel malts, evolving with an earthy hop tone that offered a nice balance to the sweet notes that had started it all. This was mellow and super smooth. Easing back down the original path, a nice touch of pecan then rolled across the tongue, mellowing out the finish and providing that last gasp of sweetness before the flavor finished out. Easily session able, I went through this one far too quickly, and the only factor I could come up with to say negatively about this is the feel was a touch under carbonated, but other then that, it was as solid as they come.<br>

Taste - Oh man, this is great. There is a great connection between the scent and the flavor. Very delicate and subtle. Pecan nuttiness shows up in the front end and lingers into the aftertaste. Chocolately and dark malts. Not too sweet - and they could have easy gone in that direction. This tastes like actual pecans and doesn't taste like extract - in fact they used actual Texas pecans and roasted the nuts themselves. Awesome. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - This has a great mouthfeel. It is smooth and velvety with a decent carbonation level. Smooth and slightly oily. Medium/full bodied. <br>
<br>
Drinkability - This beer is awesome. Great beer. Delicate smooth and even. Doesn't beat you over the face - I could drink this all night without worrying about ruining my palate. Hats off to 512. This is their best beer.<br>

3.5,53808,"Pours a clear golden orange, trending brown towards the thicker parts of the glass. The head is white, smaller than expected, and creamy. Lacing is great. Looks pretty amazing, actually. Lots of grapefruit in the aroma. Other citrus as well, and it actually smells juicy. Smells a little sweet also, like confectioner's sugar, along with dark cake. The grains are coming across very differently in this one than normal. Instead of biscuity and dense, it seems to be light, sweet, and fluffy. Flavor starts with the typical bready, biscuity notes, followed by a slight yeast tang, then it goes bitter. The bitterness is strong and aggressive, though there is some citrus in there too, mostly orange. The feel is appropriate for the style, if very slightly viscous. Finish is balanced. <br>
<br>
As it warms the hops subside and the bread crust malt flavors overrun your palate. It's great for about two ounces of the bomber and good for 20.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">931 characters</span><br><br>","Sep 27, 2013",4,4.25,3.5,-9.3%,3.5,3.25,Philousa

Look - Pours a hazy caramel brown with a huge foamy head that dissipates rather quickly but retains about a cm at the bottom. Lacing slides and little chunks stick.<br>

Smell - Caramel malt and subtle fruity hops with a touch of pine hop resin.<br>

Look - golden color, fairly clear, with about half a finger's worth of off-white-colored foam that dissipates quickly.<br>
<br>
Smell - definitely floral, as one would expect from an IPA. I seem to smell Cascade hops, which would make sense given that it's brewed in the Northwest. Apart from that, I can't denote anything else.<br>
<br>
Taste - very hoppy, hoppier than I would have expected given the milder aroma. It doesn't really have the taste of Cascade hops, or at least not at first. Cascade hops might be present, but not in the forefront. I almost want to guess something in the range of Amarillo hops, but that's just a guess. The strength of the hops doesn't last long. This brew finishes fairly smoothly. It leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste that almost has another wave of intensity before burning out. Very interesting beer.<br>

4,53808,"Very slight cloudiness in this golden orange IPA with a pleasant head of light foam that leaves somewhat quickly leaving a consistent cap.<br>
<br>
The nose is typical in the North-West vein. When other reviewers refer to BIG grapefruit and tangerine in the nose, as they do with so many other IPAs, I have to wonder what they are comparing it to? I keep smelling fresh cantaloupe and caramel with a hint of alcohol. <br>
<br>
When I think of BIG grapefruit, in terms of a single IPA, I think of AleSmith, which really hits the mark at an extra $1.50 per bomber. The characteristics of the North-West &amp; South-West IPAs are clearly different and something I am smelling and tasting with more definition each time I sample.<br>
<br>
The flavors, to my palate, are a nice example of a NW IPA,but certainly nothing that blows me away. More lingering flavors of cantaloupe and raw Bavarian pretzel dough: same thing many others deliver in a similar fashion. Easily as good as Gigantic IPA and very much in that same Oregon style that is becoming more familiar to me.<br>
<br>
 I recommend the $5 bomber rather than investing $12 in the six pack to see if Apocalypse is your taste or not. If you are looking for a more truly defined grapefruit/pine/tangerine nose,flavor and aftertaste, spend the extra buck-and-a-half on the AleSmith bomber and you won't regret it.<br>

4.11,53808,"22 oz bottle into a pint glass.<br>
<br>
A: Pours a dark gold color with middling clarity. The head is an impressive looking four finger (via aggressive pour) offwhite shade. Retention here is quite strong, and as the head slowly recedes, plenty of lacing is left on the glass.<br>
<br>
S: Big grapefruit here on the nose. A bit of malt sweetness breaks up all the hops, but ultimately, the pine, black pepper, and grapefruit qualities from the hops win out. <br>
<br>
T: Similar to the aroma, the dominant flavor on the palate is grapefruit-derived hop flavors. I half-expected an upsurge of bitter, piny hop flavors on the back end, but no. The bitterness is really well restrained here, seemingly replaced with savory, nonintrusive caramel malts and bright citrus peel. Nonintrusive is the key word here - to me, an overt malt backbone can kill an IPA worse than excessive hop bitterness can, and this strikes a balance between the two aspects. As it warms up, the flavor really takes on a savory, herbal bend to it, especially on the finish.<br>
<br>
M: The texture features good dryness, however it could be a bit lighter in my opinion. Still, I like the lack of palate wrecking bitterness here. I'd almost call it 'soft' - but not quite.<br>

Jimmy said so, eh? Well, he didn't tell us what kind of hops were used. I'm guessing they're of the NZ type. Citrus mango tango?<br>

Flavor confirms the aroma. It's not your usual pine/grapefruit affair. Refreshing. Not much dough. <br>

A: Pours a brilliant clear deep gold, with a white head that leaves behind a little lace.<br>

S: Interesting profile, though nothing *pops* or is as prominent as I would like in an IPA...there is tropical fruit, caramel, overripe mango, touch of honey.<br>

Got a bottle at my local grocery store to give it a try...ya that sounds lame but it was for $3.79.<br>

The smell was really ripe with that hoppy citrus and a touch of pine like many nw IPAs. It also has that biscuit tone that I like from the malts.<br>
<br>
The taste is where this one takes control. The 6.5% tastes more like 7.5%. Not in booze but in bitterness. Very bitter and not watered down or tame like some in this category. With the bitterness was the citrusy sweet flavors I savor in an IPA. Really surprised for such a cheap IPA. Impressive.<br>

<br>
A-Pours a very slightly hazing copper orange with a two finger, off-white head with decent retention but scant lacing. Very pleasing appearance.<br>
<br>
S-Aroma is disappointingly faint. Slight floral and citrus hops are subdued by ""a generous helping of Victory malt"" that gives this beer a predominantly biscuit/nutty aroma. Not what I want in an IPA. <br>
<br>
T-With the name being such, I was expecting something more earth ending, at least as we know it. No such luck. This ends up being another ""also ran"" IPA. I think the Victory malt ruined this beer. I used this malt in a brown ale for its nutty attributes and was very pleased. I would never have thought to use it in an IPA. Odd. As with the aroma, the taste is malt dominant; the nutty/biscuit profile detracts from the fine hop bill: Horizon, Centennial, Amarillo, and Cascade. Great hops, and at 65 IBUs (if accurate), this is plenty hoppy to be an IPA. Not harsh or aggressive assault on the taste buds; I suspect some first wort hopping used. This is not bad; it's just not what it should be and I think the culprit is the Victory malt.<br>
<br>
M-Very smooth but a bit thin and light, especially for an IPA.<br>
<br>
O-This is decent. I really wanted to like this better than I did. I bought tonight since I was seeking something new. I wouldn't turn this beer away if offered one, but I probably won't buy it again.<br>

Two commendations: (1) this brewery uses bottle dating. 7/25/2011 in this case.

Wonderful hoppy aromas. Very resiny and green, herbal, with some earthiness, and pine as well.<br>

<br>
The nose pays equal homage to malt and hops, which is not the way to go in an American IPA. The main issue is that Victory malt (similar to Munich in terms of earthy nuttiness) is one member of the grain bill. It ends up taking a bite out of what could have been a killer aroma, with such notables as Centennial, Amarillo and Cascade (along with Horizon) in the house.<br>
<br>
Apocalypse IPA is decent beer that is in no way apocalyptic. It needs a larger percentage of pale malt and it needs more hops. Both, of course, are personal preferences. It tastes like most of the original 65 IBUS are still present, so the bomber is reasonably fresh. Good hop flavor, though, is somewhat lacking.<br>
<br>
Each mouthful delivers lightly toasted bread, a small handful of baked nuts, grapefruit zest, orange zest, and a woody spiciness whose origins are a mystery. This is an okay version of my favorite style, but it definitely needs some work.<br>
<br>
The mouthfeel is more APA than IPA. It's thinner than it should be, doesn't bulk up as it warms, and the bubbles are within the wide range of acceptable. Not exactly a ringing endorsement.<br>
<br>
Apocalypse IPA is one of those beers that is impressing less and less with each passing ounce. That isn't such a good thing when the bottle contains 22 ounces rather than 12. Hopefully, 10 Barrel Brewing will deliver the goods with S1nist0r Black Ale, a bomber of which is biding its time in my cellar as we speak.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,681 characters</span><br><br>","Aug 25, 2010",3,4,3.5,-9.8%,3.5,3.5,BuckeyeNation

Pours burnished copper with a rocky, two inch head of eggshell white. Plenty of smeary lacing and a solid foam cap for the duration of the glass.<br>

<br>
Appearance: A medium bodied amber, crystal clear through the middle and... oh wow the carbonation. Tons of carbonation in this guy. Head retention is pretty good for an IPA. It seems a little on the light side but I also usually drink my IPAs out of the bottle instead of in a glass.<br>
<br>
Smell: A little pine, a little resin, a little citrus. I get some of the floral notes of the hops but its not kicking me in the face like I expected. Not bad, its just not standing out at me right now, I wonder if its my glassware? There is a little something I can't quiet place in this beer, it seems a bit off for some reason.<br>
<br>
Taste: There's the hops I was looking for, you can't smell it but you can taste it on the front end and the back. Not the hop bomb that Firestone's Union Jack or Bear Republic's Racer 5 is but its nice and subtle, a little more in the PNW style.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied but extremely solid. Chewy-deliciousness, just the way an IPA should be.<br>
<br>
Drinkability: Very good drinkability. It doesn't smash me the way some of these high IBU IPAs do. All those hops really wear out my pallet fast, this beer doesn't suffer from that problem. Hurray beer!<br>

4.38,53808,"Bomber poured into my large St. Feuillien goblet, Apocalypse IPA is a lightly hazed ruddy bronze with a small off-white skim of head with a bubbly collar that leaves elegant, draping lace. <br>
<br>
Smell is dank and resinous hops, skunky, with some sweet gingerbread malt notes. Robust, perhaps the only knock is that it smells like the alcohol might be dirty (which it it very well may be the hops style, but as I'm enjoying it, the fusels are hidden on the palate). <br>
<br>
Taste is also robust, classic NW IPA with the huge, fresh hops, and a fairly substantial malt base as well, mostly bread, some sweetness. While the hops have some substantial bitterness, they combine with the sweetness of the malt to bring out some tropical citrus that you don't get in the nose. The lingering aftertaste is hop resins, like you've chewed on one. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel is oily, a bit chewy. The tongue is really coated with hop resin in hurry, did I mention this beer is dank? I like it for the audacity it reminds you this beer brings. <br>
