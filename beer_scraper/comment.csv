Drinkable and enjoyable, though its hop pungency could be improved. I'd definitely take this over Community's Mosaic IPA in terms of the local market, but if you're brewing a Mosaic hopped IPA in Texas you'll always be in the shadow of Lone Pint's Yellow Rose, and this doesn't quite measure up. Definitely worth trying, and a beer I'd revisit if offered in sixers at a fair price.<br>

It is malty, nicely balanced, and has a stinging characteristic that can be described as medicinal, but it’s flavorful to sip, just a well-made DIPA. When it seems it may end too dry, it doesn’t quite get that far. But it is a dry bite of a finish. The malt backbone does this one well.

Well-executed. Soft wheat provides the foundation with leavening 2-row in there so it isn't gummy. Coriander spice is evident, harmonizing nicely with the estery Belgian yeast. Hints of cracked grains/grains of paradise. I get lemon peel but apparently grapefruit peel is utilized...I don't find it. Remarkably well-balanced.<br>
<br>
Depth of flavour could be improved, as could intricacy.<br>
<br>
Refreshing, smooth, and wet. A softer more delicate mouthfeel would help it rival the greats in the style.<br>

Devilishly drinkable, and a solid true to form beer in the style. It's not Allagash White, but it does rival if not best local competitor Celis White - and that may say it all. I'll definitely be revisiting this one.<br>

L:  dark brown, clear, pushes up 1-inch head of beige foam on strong pour; it's dark and hard to see through but appears it may be clear ... crystal clear; dark amber-orange, burnt orange, almost into purple ... but, yes, it's light enough to see through it up to light, nice clarity; no major sticking or lacing but keeps a thick collar and most of a skin; about 10-15 minutes in, the skin disappears ... noticeably disappears ... but the collar is still hanging around; if this brew stuck and laced, it's be a candidate for a 5<br>

S:  tart toasted cranberries, fingernail polish remover -- those dominate, then way back there hiding in the shadows of the barn is a bit of previously wet grain sack now dried out ... not ""clean"" as in out of the washing machine clean, but clean as in it's not still wet and growing mold and mildew; might be the mildest but still distinct fingernail polish remover note I've come across -- it's *always* there, but it's never sharp or overpowering ... perhaps a better descriptor: lemon-raspberry<br>
<br>
T:  almost 1:1 following the nose with a minor adjustment -- a little more tart earthy flavor and toasted cranberries and a little less fingernail polish remover; as it warms and the palate adjusts, a bit of raspberry and blackberry, the more tart ones that haven't found their sweetness yet; as it warms more, some sweetness shows up just often enough to really make this tasty ... it's like those few grains of salt or sugar that bring out the flavors even more<br>

O:  wonderful ... a treat of a beer for my particular tastes buds, for it's very reminiscent of a Flanders red or oud bruin with the nice toasted malt flavors blending into the sour flavors, and I love those styles and that mix; when those toasted cranberries offer up some sweetness, my goodness!  you get some raspberry/blackberry flavor and want to start drinking it like it's a 3% kriek lambic.  I will buy this beer over and over ... a perfect summer brew and a perfect ""sour"" fix whenever you want.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">2,384 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 15, 2017",5,4.25,4.25,,4,4.25,Premo88

<br>
L:  murky gold, about as dark as gold can get without adding amber, like a dull light bronze; pushes up late-percolating creamy head of foam about 3/4 to a full inch tall; keeps thick collar and most of a skin; light sticking, no lacing<br>
<br>
S:  hoppy ... green hops, grassy, a little lime ... citrus note is strong, grapefruit ... yes, as it warms, more and more grapefruit; biscuit malt under the thick layer of hops, very subtle<br>
<br>
T:  mix of grapefruit, generic citrus hop flavor with a more pronounced biscuit malt flavor, almost bready malt; hops are juicy and only lightly bitter and are really smoothed out by that malt sweetness; bitterness shows up in aftertaste, lingering grapefruit peel, almost earthy<br>
<br>
F:  ale soft, almost slick, feels a bit light but there's enough carbonation to add a piece of heft to it; not sure if it lost a lot of carbonation overnight in the half growler, but ... well ... how shall we say?  it's definitely an ale, not a lager (as it should be, no?)<br>
<br>
O:  lovely little hoppy beer, slightly soft mouthfeel but I could see some finding its velvety smoothness perfect; the grapefruit notes are spot on, and the light malt backbone is just enough to add a little sweetness<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,352 characters</span><br><br>","Aug 27, 2017",3.5,4,4,,4.5,4,Premo88

on tap @ Craft Pride, Austin, TX on 5 November 2015<br>
$5.50 / 6.5 oz.<br>
<br>
Notes: Listed at 8.2% ABV... not sure what year it is. The barrel actually brings out the pecan in comparison to the regular, unless of course there's actually double pecans in use - I tasted them side by side. Bourbon and oak are found in the aroma along with a mild dark roastiness. The flavor follows with an additional touch of fruit and chocolate and milky coffee; and then finishes with fruit, cocoa, a hint of alcohol (Bourbon) and coconut. Medium bodied with a median carbonation. It's unlike any beer I've ever tasted, and I've had other pecan beers before. Was it worth the cost? Probably when you consider that it's a beer you sip at rather than just drink down; and that there are added costs in the ingredients (mainly the pecans) to get it to where it is. In any case it's unique, and probably worth trying based on that alone, but I'd suggest you look for the standard version as well so that you can compare the two.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,065 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 20, 2017",4,4,4.25,,4,4.25,NeroFiddled

2.49,86328,"Reviewed from notes taken at the Dog and Duck in Austin, TX in 2014.<br>
<br>
On-draught.<br>
<br>
HEAD: ~1cm wide. White in colour. Supple. Decent thickness and creaminess. Above average (~3 minute) retention. Nice even lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head recedes.<br>
<br>
BODY: Translucent murky dark copper. Nontransparent. I see no yeast/lees within; it's a clean looking brew.<br>
<br>
Appears adequately carbonated.<br>
<br>
AROMA: Milky/whoppery malts, cream, pale English malts, butterscotch, floral and herbal hop notes, buttery toffee. No yeasty notes are detectable.<br>
<br>
Not boozy.<br>
<br>
A pleasant aroma of mild strength, though I do have concerns about potential diacetyl off-flavour based on the buttery notes so prominent in the aroma.<br>
<br>
TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Very buttery and milky, with a sickly English pale malt backbone corrupted by the buttery/butterscotch-redolent diacetyl that dominates the brew. Light floral and herbal hop character is in there too, along with some toffee. <br>
<br>
Has a light creamy feel on the palate. Medium-bodied. Has an okay thickness that doesn't really support the malt backbone all that well. Overcarbonated.<br>
<br>
Too sweet overall; definitely imbalanced even though the build boasts fair cohesion. The flavours showcased here just really don't appeal to me personally; maybe an English ale purist would find more value in this brew than I do.<br>
<br>
Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour. Not a complex, subtly executed, or nuanced brew by any stretch.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Not 512's strongest work. I don't care much for this one in particular, and wouldn't get it again. It'll be a chore to finish this.<br>

3.07,139105,"Reviewed from notes taken in Spring 2015.<br>
<br>
Served from a cask into a nonic at Banger's in Austin, TX. Cost was $7.50 USD per 16 oz.<br>
<br>
6.8% ABV.<br>
<br>
HEAD: 1.5 fingers in height. Creamy, full, and thick, with a soft appearance and an even consistency. Supple. No lacing adheres to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. Retention is average (~2 minutes).<br>
<br>
BODY: Opaque dark black. No yeast/lees are visible within.<br>
<br>
Looks nice for a porter, but it doesn't have any unique or special characteristics. Appears undercarbonated (a seeming casualty of its unfortunate cask dispensing).<br>
<br>
I'm optimistic going in.<br>
<br>
AROMA: Muted dark malts, faint caramelized pecan, a faint kiss of fruit (I guess cherry), and buried roast.<br>
<br>
Nowhere near as evocative/expressive as it should be. Aromatic intensity is quite light.<br>
<br>
Again, this seems worse for having been cask-dispensed.<br>
<br>
TASTE: Dark malt sweetness, faint chocolate, a kiss of coconut, a bit of faint cherry and vague dark fruit. Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour.<br>
<br>
Has adequate complexity and subtlety, but this can't compete on those terms with the best expressions of the style.<br>
<br>
TEXTURE: Undercarbonated, thin, smooth, wet, unrefreshing. Suits the taste okay, but doesn't elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Downable, but not an improvement on 512's Pecan Porter or a better expression of a porter overall. I wouldn't buy it again, but it is above average (i.e. I'd take this over your run of the mill Sam Adams variety pack porter). Worse off for having been dispensed from a cask.<br>

<br>
Jammy Cabernet wine notes are evident, blending conspicuously into the flavour profile and partially eclipsing the delicate Belgian yeast flavour the beer features. Hints of pear. Belgian pale malt.<br>
<br>
ABV is well disguised, unlike many beers in the style.<br>
<br>
Very drinkable, showcasing Cabernet rather well, though I don't know that the base tripel is all that impressive itself. Still, I wouldn't have thought Cabernet would play so well in a tripel. Definitely a beer I'd buy by the sixer if offered at a $12-13 price.<br>

<br>
Pours a creamy pale khaki head atop an opaque black body. Head retention is poor; this dies within 30 seconds (if that).<br>
<br>
Aroma suggests a scintilla of burnt malt, some dark malt sweetness, floral hops, herbal hops, and evergreen hop aromatics. Pleasant and inviting, seemingly marrying dark malt sweetness and hop bitterness to good effect. Aromatic intensity is average.<br>
<br>
Tastes of evergreen/faint pine, floral hops, and subdued dark malt sweetness...I suspect the malt bill is mainly pale malt with dark malt or carafa in there more for colour than flavour... that's kind of cheating in terms of Cascadian dark ales. Hints of bready malt, ale yeast esters, and resin.<br>
<br>
Creamy, smooth, wet, medium to full-bodied. Well-carbonated.<br>
<br>
Depth of flavour is limited, as is hop pungency.<br>
<br>
A solid Cascadian dark ale if a subdued one; dial up the hop pungency, scale back the 2-row committing more to the carafa, and keep this level of balance and we'll have a real contender on our hands.<br>

S:  grain, sour grain, almost medicinal at its coldest; as it warms, still hangs on to that light medicinality, you could almost call it herbal or earthy ... or a herbal/earthy mix thing of some kind; as it warms a bit more, it has a toasted bread with a little brown sugar or molasses ... so light but it's there<br>

F:  very midweight ale soft, almost fluffy, up front with loads of what feels like tiny prickly bubbles giving it a drinkable crisp finish; feels very sturdy and wonderful for both sipping or taking on a good medium-sized swallow<br>

T:  Like the nose, this is very simple and to the point.  Baked bread, toasted malts mainly.  Again, finishes with a touch of earthy /grassy/spicy hops.  A bitterness builds a little as this warms.<br>

A:  Pours a copper/amber/reddish color. A two finger white head forms with good retention initially, and a bit of spotty lace.<br>
S:  Big buttery aromas up front.  Some fruity esters linger.  Pears, apples, along with some light wood.  Not bad, the buttery notes through me off a bit.  Though I think that is from the wine barrel.  <br>
T:  Again, a substantial buttery character up front.  I am not that well verst in Cab, let alone wines in general.  Though, considering I have never encountered buttery diacetyl in regular 512 Tripel, I am thinking this comes from the wine barrel.  Fruity esters come next.  Pears and apples are apparent, along with a slight tartness and acidity.<br>
M/D:  A medium body that is effervescent and super crisp.  I love the carbonation here.  Appropriately weighty as well.  Easy to drink, even with the buttery character.  Something I can come back to with ease.<br>
<br>
I am almost positive the buttery character comes from the wine barrel.  It is not so much a detriment, just not what I was really expecting.  Though once I get use to it, the esters come out and are great.  I think the alcohol is well hidden as well.  Overall, very interesting, and something I will come back to.  If not a complete barrel aged masterpiece, enjoyable for what it is.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,309 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 05, 2016",4,3.75,4,-1.6%,3.5,3.75,champ103

First off, this is an excellent stout. Incredibly balanced and not an overwhelming maltiness you expect in a stout. Good head that retains a small ring all the way through til the end and leaves lots of lacing. Refreshing mouth feel. Explosion of flavors roasted barley, coffee, sweetness, and finishes with the perfect amount of slight spice and chile flavor that leaves you craving more.

Appearance - Served up in a clear, plastic pint cup with a quarter finger of light khaki head. The brew itself is cola brown in color, and the head settles to a thin layer.<br>
<br>
Smell - Citrusy aroma with light pine and a touch of bread and caramel.<br>
<br>
Taste - Follows the nose. Citrus hops with lesser notes of pine. Malts are distant, but hints of roast and chocolate do peak through briefly. <br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - Medium in body with a nice bite from the carbonation. Slick texture, going down smooth before a semi-dry finish.<br>

3.59,65536,"I had this on-tap recently and adored it, so I jumped at the chance to nab a 64 oz growler fill today. Reviewed live as a milk stout.<br>
<br>
Served chilled into a pilsner glass in Austin, TX, and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Expectations are high. The weight and angle of the growler necessitated an unusually vigorous pour.<br>
<br>
No bubble show forms as it's poured.<br>
<br>
HEAD: 4 fingers wide. Gorgeous tan colour, great creaminess. Full, thick, and supple, with a soft overall appearance and an even consistency. Leaves a webby coating of lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes. Retention is excellent - easily 10 minutes. This is damned impressive.<br>
<br>
BODY: As you'd expect, it's an opaque solid jet black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.<br>
<br>
Overall, it's a great looking milk stout. There are of course ways it could be improved - a darker richer head, a bubble show, a better complexion - but that's nitpicking.<br>
<br>
AROMA: The subtle ancho chile characteristics are fantastic, and the chile is just as present as it should be. The lactose sugar, dark malt, and chocolate malt-induced sweetness isn't too overt; in fact, this may be one of the more restrained milk stout aromas I've ever encountered. The roasted barley is nowhere near as prominent as it ought to be.<br>
<br>
Overall, the aroma promises a balanced no-frills milk stout with some interesting chile character. Aromatic intensity is mild at most.<br>
<br>
No off-notes, hop character, or yeast character is detectable. This is certainly to style.<br>
<br>
TASTE: Not quite as good as I remember it being on-draught.<br>
<br>
The chile heat in the third act is the first element I notice, but it's present from the early second act - it's just so subtly executed. It does grow on you and intensify as the beer comes to temperature, which I love. The chile heat isn't bad by any means - on par with mild ancho. I can't see anyone needing a second beverage whilst drinking this.<br>
<br>
Predictably, dark/schwarz malts, chocolate malts, and lactose sugar fill out the malt backbone and lend it sweetness, but this isn't anywhere near as sweet as I expected, and is certainly on the tamer side for the style. Added complexity comes from cream, a hint of marshmallow, and a touch of roast. I crave more roasted barley, and constructively this build could do with still more intricacy - why not coffee, hazelnut, caramelized pecan, actual chocolate, cocoa nibs, vanilla bean, etc. It's adequately complex, but there's room for more.<br>
<br>
The blend of admittedly basic dark malt sweetness with the subtle chile is just damned effective. There's an elegance to this beer's straightforward quality and balance.<br>
<br>
The flavour duration is long, largely as result of the subtle chile heat that lingers into the aftertaste, encouraging another sip. Flavour depth and intensity are average or above average. This is absolutely a cohesive brew, and I do find that it tastes like a gestalt whole; it's hard to imagine removing anything. And the chile doesn't feel forced into the otherwise standard milk stout build at all.<br>
<br>
I'm really enjoying this one, but my biggest issue is with the light vinegar that accompanies the chile - though I don't remember this characteristic from the draught version.<br>
<br>
TEXTURE: Smooth, creamy, wet, and medium-bodied, with modest thickness. It's not a syrupy, sticky, or viscous mess like it could be. It's unrefreshing, but then no good milk stout isn't. Well-carbonated. Has adequate weight and heft on the palate, but it's not boozy. The alcohol is well-disguised.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Easily the most memorable milk stout I've had this year so far, and frankly I doubt I'll see it beaten. For my money, this crushes market imposters from other states like Left Hand's Milk Stout or Odell's Lugene's, but I'm not sure whether I prefer this or Lakewood's The Temptress in the Texan market. In any case, it's high praise when a milk stout is mentioned in the same vein as those other quality offerings, and I'll definitely plan on having this again. This growler fill has numbered days, gentlemen. This is worth seeking out when in Texas, and manages to attain a high drinkability even with the presence of chile heat - which is very tough to do. This is absolutely one of 512's best beers.<br>
<br>
B<br>
<br>
***<br>
02.05.15: 2nd impressions from the same growler:<br>
<br>
The chile is muted when this is served cold, and the sweetness takes over to its detriment. Needs time to warm.<br>
<br>
Though it has (already) deteriorated somewhat in the growler, it remains a tasty brew with subtle chili heat and aptly high sweetness. Roasted barley presence would be nice, but overall it's pretty well balanced for what it is and I definitely like it.<br>
<br>
Its high sweetness does limit its drinkability, but it's easily one of the best milk stouts available in Texas and in the USA (based on what I've had). Well worth trying.<br>

3.01,125693,"12oz bottle, from a random grocery store in Sandpoint, Idaho.  Maybe a strange introduction to this brewery for me, but they was sellin' it, and I was buyin'.<br>
<br>
This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with just a few teensy floaties, and one finger of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly just bubbly dirty white head, which leaves some minor low-lying raincloud lace around the glass as things quickly settle.<br>
<br>
It smells of semi-sweet lemon and lime juice, bready pale malt, a soft stoney flintiness, and an ethereal and rather indistinct bitterness.  The taste is fairly sweet lemon/lime, perhaps a bit of those sugary candied orange slices for good measure, an underwhelmingly malty graininess, and a still hard to detect, wan, and let's just say leafy and earthy bitterness.<br>
<br>
The carbonation is pretty much inert for the most part, barely a frothy tickle to be bargained for, the body a so-so middleweight, but bolstered by that heady saccharine character, so of course it's smooth, smooth, smooth!  It finishes sweet, but on the downswing, as my palate, being North American, is now duly acclimatized, and I now find this not to be all that.<br>
<br>
Yeah, a simple fruit beer, one where the underlying brew is more or less obfuscated, in that it's hard to determine (or just not worth it) if it's even a lager or a blonde ale in there.  Kind of flat, overall, and not in the same league as the better domestic citrus radlers currently available, if you look around.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,479 characters</span><br><br>","Aug 08, 2015",3.5,3,2.5,,3.25,3,biboergosum

Mini-growler fill from the Boise pub tonight... Poured into my new Teku... Beautiful pinkish orange with little head retention or lacing.. Bright REAL strawberry in the nose and on the palate.. lemon lactic notes freshen up the fruitiness.. Like an adult strawberry lemonade.. Strawberry beers are tough to get right and still pack enough fruit in... This one is done well... Would LOVE to see it in bottles at some point.<br>

3.35,75401,"Foeder II: Brewed Apr 2013 / Bottled Feb 2015. Served cold into a goblet and allowed to warm over the course of consumption.<br>
<br>
Truncated notes below:<br>
<br>
HEAD: Full and luscious, with good thickness and a nice even consistency. Good complexion. Creamy and frothy. Retention is average; this lasts for only 2 minutes. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. ~1 inch wide.<br>
<br>
BODY: Oddly, it's an opaque solid black. Not an ink black or jet black, but rather dark. I see no yeast or hop sediment.<br>
<br>
It's strangely dark for a sour, but the head is promising. Appears adequately carbonated.<br>
<br>
AROMA: Has plenty of wild ale characteristics, with wild ale yeasts, an eclectic sourness which isn't limited to the usual lactobacillus - but rather showcases pediococcus shockingly well, faint oak barrel, and hints of muted cherry fruit. It does suffer a bit from a minor dampened cardboard note - giving it a musty and surprisingly dry aroma, but overall the pediococcus alone has me interested in this beer. It's more tart than sour, and it isn't even that tart; you'd think they'd commit more to that given the cherry note. In any case, I'd guess the sourness is around a 3/10 in terms of intensity just from the aroma.<br>
<br>
Aromatic intensity is average.<br>
<br>
TASTE: Pediococcus bacteria is in control here, giving it a mild sourness (~2/10 in terms of intensity) which sour fans will find wanting. Its 9% ABV is shockingly well concealed. The cherry is muted to its detriment, and it lacks sufficient tartness. Slightly acetic, though more of an acetic pie crust character on par with Rodenbach would do wonders. I find no brettanomyces funkiness. I'm doubting lactobacillus was used, but such usage would definitely improve this beer - both by giving it more sourness and by lending the mouthfeel a needed acidic smackiness.<br>
<br>
The barrel is in the background, but it doesn't really integrate well into the base. The abovementioned dampened cardboard note does make an appearance - a byproduct of oversoaked oak wood. But the oak itself lends nothing to improve the beer aside from a weak generic musty wood note that I suppose lends the build some cohesion.<br>
<br>
Not tart or sour enough to appease the discerning sour drinker, but the pediococcus is nice. Compared to the best beers in the style, it's rather shallow and simple, with a subpar balance. I do like it in a general sense, but it leaves much to be desired.<br>
<br>
TEXTURE: Slightly acetic and definitely of above average acidity. Unrefreshing, medium-bodied, oddly dry and musty, and smooth. A sharper tangier more acidic feel would help complement the sour notes nicely, and a more smacky texture would help play up the pucker factor.<br>
<br>
There's no harmony of texture to taste, but this isn't badly executed by any stretch. A bit overcarbonated, sure, but overall it does an okay job complementing the taste.<br>
<br>
OVERALL: Not a bad first foray into wild fermentation, but way off the mark if 512 is hoping to compete with Jester King or even Real Ale in the Austin, TX market. I'll have no trouble finishing the entire 750ml bottle by myself, and I imagine that imperceptible 9% ABV will catch up to me. I wouldn't buy this again, especially at its extortionate price relative to its (lack of) quality, but it shows definite promise in terms of what we can expect from 512's wild/sour efforts in the future. I do have to ask - why weren't the brettanomyces yeast and pediococcus bacteria added during primary fermentation, instead of after?<br>

3.04,45496,"First go from this brewery. Pour appears black until the light hits, giving off a deep Ruby/Brown hue, accompanied by a very thin head that fades quite fast, along with very minimal lace.<br>
<br>
Smells of roasted grains, malt and caramel. Some vanilla as it warms. Following through on the taste spectrum is roasted grain, malts and caramel, accompanied by faint chocolate and grass. Some light banana from the yeast. Slightly nutty. Very thin and close to watery; gives off an almost dark soda-like feel. Smooth, dry.<br>
<br>
This one, for me, missed out on the rich, deep roasty aspect that I love in the Schwarzbier style. I can see they went for a different take on this one, but the styles seemed to clash and cause it to fall short. Not a bad beer, but there are a plethora of better ones of this style out there. Still grateful to try this one. Cheers.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">846 characters</span><br><br>","Jun 05, 2016",2.5,3.5,3,-16.7%,3.25,3,anon

Appearance:  moderately cloudy salmon-pink body with a finger of pillowy pink foam atop.  It definitely looks the part for a raspberry beer.<br>

Smell:  nice raspberry character with a little bit of acidity underneath.  A bit one-dimensional, but nice.<br>

Taste:  bright and acidic, but with enough sweetness and fruit flavor to be balanced.  It's not candylike, as there is a little bit of funk, and I think that works well here.  I like it.<br>

Mouthfeel:  medium-light body with a decent carbonation and creaminess.<br>

Pours an opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted nut, cocoa powder, and dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, dark fruit, cocoa powder, earth, and char flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that smells solid, but the flavors clash together somewhat to me. <br>

S:  The nose is great.  Musty yeast, tart fruits of cherries, grapes, and apples.  Even some citrusy orange rind.  This all intermingles with some light tannins and oak.  The Brett yeast, bacteria and wood all work really well here.<br>
T:  The oak tannins are a bit more prevalent and up front than the nose.  Up front is a litle sweet as well, but that fades as this warms and everything else takes over.  Less of that musty basement character that I love, but still present and builds as this warms.  Lightly tart fruits that follow the nose.  It just doesn't hit all the right notes perfectly like the nose.  Still very good anyway.<br>
M/O:  A light to medium body.  Incredibly effervescent and spritzy.  Tannins all over the place, which I really like.  Very enjoyable and easy to drink.  The 750ml will be gone in no time.  <br>
<br>
I have typically found 512's sour or wild ales a bit one noted and not particularly interesting.  This is really well done though.  With two years in a wine barrel, this gets a little tannin heavy, but it does work with the yeast and bacteria.  Very much worth a try, and something I would recommend.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,322 characters</span><br><br>","Sep 02, 2015",4.25,3.75,4.25,,4.25,4,champ103

A-A normal pour produces about a finger of white foam. The retention is OK and the head leaves a little bit of fine lacing on the glass as I drink. The beer beneath the head is an unattractive yellow with a bit of haze to it. Some champagne-like carbonation is visible.<br>
<br>
S-The aroma is heavy on the cucumber, which has a seriously sweet flavor to it; almost like candy. I also sniff some lemon and lime tartness and just a hint of light funk that reminds me of cheese. Weird stuff, but not awful.<br>
<br>
T-The taste is also heavy on the cucumber. It is a bit fake tasting with a lot of candy-like sweetness to go with the cucumber flavors. The lemon-lime flavors remind me of Sprite or 7-Up and the only flavor that is close to normal beer is the mild lactic acidity that fades to a grainy finish. <br>
<br>
M-The beer is light and effervescent on the palate. Carbonation is fine and bubbly. Like soda.<br>
<br>
O-The can says this beer is trying to introduce people to sours and ride the wave of popularity for sour beers, but this stuff hardly tastes like beer.

 Surprised by how citrusy the aroma is. Very hops forward with orange zest, lemon and herbal dank that is IPA like. <br>
Even more surprised by the taste, which is not only citrusy, but also juicy and sweet. Flavors of orange, pear and papaya contribute to an odd mesh of fruity sweetness. There is some peppery bitterness, but it is quite minimal and doesn’t provide so much balance. <br>
First impressions are that this is more of an IPL considering how hoppy it is and for its light lager body. However, although it has a certain crispness to it, it seems to lack the dryness of a true pils. Neither an IPA, Pilsner, or IPL, perhaps they are stretching for a new style? A New England IPL?

T: Lots of bitterness in this one. Grapefruit and pine up front. Kind of a coffee-like bitterness up front too. Lots of pretzels and then char.

<br>
Aroma of pineapple immediately lifts up to the olfactory, even at the pour; further analysis follows with stone fruits and more veiny pineapple. <br>
<br>
Flavor is of sour and rindy tropical fruit to start, namely pineapple, getting the passion fruit here as well; as it drifts to the middle of the tongue the malts come into play as a pale counterpart, and then it finishes on white grapefruit and orange pith. <br>
<br>
Feel is more chalky or pasty than I'd like, it sort of clings onto the mouth and doesn't let go easily even though I want it to. This is one of those more rare circumstances where I'd prefer the beer to be a bit more thin, a bit more watery, just to help it along and not linger around with those rindy off-notes. <br>
<br>
Overall another average beer from 10 Barrel. If you're really that curious, try it for yourself, otherwise move along. It's not a pineapple bomb, and it's not a real hoppy ale...just kind of floats in the superfluous middle.

edit: just had this on tap at the portland brewery and its absolute delicious, a totally different animal than the beer i reviewed here in denver. its dramatically different, juicier, fresher, way less sweet than i remember, and just a tip top ipa overall. i am bumping up some scores to reflect the perfect specimen at the brewery. i didnt find too much bitterness at all. i think it might not hold up super well, or got warm or something in transit to this market, but fresh at the brewery it was sensational!<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,574 characters</span><br><br>","Nov 24, 2015",3.75,3.75,4,-3.7%,3.75,4,StonedTrippin

3.53,99154,"Poured from 22oz bomber into a tulip.<br>
<br>
Appearance:  very deep, rich, dark brown with a murky haziness.  Head is a finger of creamy tan foam which has a good retention and leaves a great lace on the glass.  Quite attractive.<br>
<br>
Smell:  roasty, nutty, a little bready and perhaps a bit chocolatey.  Not bad, but it smells more like a big brown ale than a stout, and it is a bit on the bready/biscuity side for my taste.<br>
<br>
Taste:  quite roasty with a bit of edge to it, there's also plenty of toastiness, nuttiness and biscuit to it.  Certainly not the worst stout out there, but I prefer an emphasis on the roasty, chocolatey flavors, whereas this seems more like a very dark brown ale or even a ""black amber"" -- which I really can't describe any other way.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel:  medium body with an OK carbonation and creaminess.  It works, but nothing to write home about.<br>
<br>
Overall: I see this being a perfectly serviceable stout, although not one that I would seek out again.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">964 characters</span><br><br>","Jan 17, 2015",3.5,4,3.5,-5.9%,3.5,3.5,flagmantho
4.27,99154,"Appearance - Pours near black with cola brown edging. The head is the color of cocoa powder and peaks at a fingers width, displaying fair retention before giving way to a thin, consistent layer of surface suds.<br>
<br>
Smell - Strong notes of roasted coffee, chocolate, earthy and floral hoppiness. <br>
<br>
Taste - Milk chocolate to start, then strong notes of coffee roast and earthy hop bitterness. Dark and Baker's chocolate and more roast hit mid-taste and linger into the finish, delivering a mostly bitter aftertaste.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel - Medium to full in body with fair carbonation. Smooth with a semi-dry finish.<br>
<br>
Overall - Flavorwise, it reminds me quite a bit of the Rogue Shakespeare Stout. Doesn't quite have the silky smoothness of the latter, but that's the difference between a regular stout and an oatmeal stout.

There's a bit of toasted grain, but the dominant aroma. The flavor is only marginally improved, offering a small amount of caramel and plum to the sawdust base. Not much in the way of malt, hop, spice, nor sweetness. The feel is also a disappointment, being pretty light and having too much zippy carbonation for what should be a heavy, rich style.<br>

Pours a fall harvest orange body.  At first pour the head appeared to be light tan / off white, but as it dissipated (rather quickly) what was left was thin and definitely white... Interesting.<br>
While the retention was minimal the lacing was decent<br>

Prominent floral scent with a little pine is reminiscent of 10 Barrel's Apocalypse IPA . The scent really benefited from a slight warm up. <br>

3.68,45496,"One of the beers in a mixed pack from 10 Barrel that I picked up.  I'm wondering about the name... isn't Schwarzbier a lager?  Why call it an ale?  I've always wondered that about Dead Guy, too.  I personally like it when breweries in this area of the country branch out and brew interesting lagers; if anything I'm more likely to grab one off the shelf if it looks different than the run of the mill ales around it.<br>
<br>
It pours dark brown but allows more light through than most brews of this color.  Not much head faded quickly and leaves scant lace.  Looks like black coffee to me, actually.<br>
<br>
Nose is pleasant but faint.  A big inhale yields something kind of bready, yeasty and sweet that reminds me of overnight waffles that my wife makes with yeast leavening, with syrup on top.<br>
<br>
Flavors are also pleasant and understated.  Bready malts with sweetness like molasses and faintly earthy hops.  Low carbonation and light body is a good mouthfeel match to the flavors.  This is the only non-IPA in the mixed pack from 10 Barrel, and it's a nice change of pace from the hops. (But Joe IPA was my favorite overall.)<br>
<br>
10 Barrel must have been in a quirky mood when naming this beer.  Not only is ""Ale"" in the name puzzling to me since I believe this is a lager, a play on ""sinister"" doesn't fit either.  This is a mild-mannered, easy going drink that would play nice with a variety of food.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,387 characters</span><br><br>","May 15, 2015",3.75,3.5,3.75,,3.5,3.75,josiahschlender

Appearance:  rich orange hue with a surprisingly light haze and a moderate effervescence.  Head is a finger of creamy ivory foam which leaves a nice thorough lace on the glass as it dissipates.  Quite attractive!<br>
<br>
Smell:  strong and sweet with a definite pumpkin aroma and a big, oaky attitude.  There are indeed rum notes, and the oak is strong in a way that makes me think of a sour, although there's not a strictly sour element to it.  Nicely complex!<br>
<br>
Taste:  big and rich pumpkin up front, with a very solid maltiness.  There is a traditional pumpkin spice here, but it's easily stood up to by the barrel.  The overall effect is muddled, but it's still a very good beer indeed.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel:  medium body with a good carbonation and concomitant creaminess.  I dig it.<br>

Smell is a delightful balance of warm, grainy sweetness with a gentle citrus tartness. They come as a one-two, more like little pushes than punches. Lovely.<br>

Taste is similar, but more tart and, well, sparkly. Lacks the warmth, but it's clean and crisp, a bit like sparkly water. Really.<br>

Smell is of, well a slight roastiness, coffee, maybe some dark sweet fruit. Kind of like cola really.<br>

I like this a lot, although I was hoping for more hops. I didn't expect a bomb of a beer such as Lagunitas nighttime, since this was only 5.7%  I can see the appeal in this beer as its velvety and roasty in such a quaint manner, that you forget your drinking a black ale at all.<br>
<br>
Mouthfeel is about average. Kind of slick, but finishes dry as far as I can tell. Medium carb.<br>

Smell - Light notes of roasted malt and some cola-like sweetness. Hints of milk chocolate.<br>
<br>
Taste - Follows the nose. General malt sweetness with hints of cola, chocolate, and very light coffee roast. Subtle notes of fruity esters and maybe even a hint of vanilla and anise in there. A light, 'brightly dark' flavor profile, if that makes any sense.<br>

Mouthfeel - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Lightly silky texture, delivering a smooth, easy drinking experience.<br>

Overall - Pretty good black lager / scharzbier, especially condsidering the style. It's a difficult style to pull off, IMO, because it doesn't quite excel in any particular area.

Ah, the familiar  mosaic hop scent. I have heard it described as smelling like onion or feet (dirty sneakers). Mosaic hops have always had that pungent, almost yeasty scent. This one doesn't disappoint!  Big mosaic presence. Overall; scent is pretty prominent. (and this beer is almost 2 months old) <br>

Booze, Booze, Booze!  Taste has a little  malt presence that I didn't smell  earlier, but the (10%) alcohol is fairly pervasive. While I enjoyed the 95 IBU bitterness.  It comes across as more of a dry alcohol type of bitterness. Enjoyable taste but a little  boozy.<br>

Feel  is slightly balanced by the malt. But at 10% ABV  it's a pretty dry feel that's making me pucker like eating sour worms...<br>

Growler fill from the Boise pub... Pours the standard black with a nice looking dark tan head that leaves good lacing... Roasty with plenty of cocoa character that jives well with an almost espresso character. IMO, this could use a little more body/sweetness to help accentuate the chocolate and roasty notes. Let this warm up to get the full effect.. Nicely done.<br>

<br>
From the bottle: ""Bend. Oregon"".<br>
<br>
I was anxious to get started, so following the Pop! of the cap, I performed an aggro pour. This resulted in the unbidden creation of two-plus fingers of solid, foamy, rocky, tawny head that looked like meringue atop the beer. Color was solid Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a mélange of qualities, including tropical fruit, cattiness, grapefruit &amp; even some pine. Oooh! This makes my hophead self VERY happy. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste began with a strong tropical fruitiness, then slowly gave way to the grapefruit bitterness as well as the cattiness noted on the nose. I did not taste pine, so maybe I was hallucinating when I smelt it on the nose. Good golly, but it was leaving some incredibly dense, sticky lacing behind as I drank it! Finish was dry &amp; bitter, more towards grapefruit &amp; cattiness than tropical fruit, but it was fine by me since it satiated my hops jones for the time being.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,106 characters</span><br><br>","Jul 11, 2017",3.75,4,4,-0.8%,4.25,3.75,woodychandler

A clear light copper with a dense, off white head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks great. The nose is solid. Fruity, mild melon, stone fruit, a little bit of pine essence, some floral honey, this is bright but restrained. A touch of candied citrus is present as well. The palate opens clean, mildly bitter and with moderate hop flavor. Mild melon, peach, pink lady apple ( especially the crisp and refreshing aspects) up front followed by a mildly sweet mid palate with honey, a little sugar and fruit juice. The finish is impeccable, clean, refreshing, fruity with just enough hop oil and hop bitterness to tie all the aspects together. Soft and creamy carbonation make this quite enjoyable as well.

2.21,230291,"I saw this at the store and was really excited because a pineapple/passionfruit beer sounds really tasty and interesting so I bought the variety 12 pack which said it included 3 bottles each of the IPA, Apocalypse IPA, Sinistor black ale, and the seasonal beer. I assumed the seasonal beer would be the Pina, but when I got home and opened the box, it turned out to be the Riding Solo APA instead, which I guess must have been the spring seasonal release. So I was really disappointed to not have the Pina, but was very pleasantly surprised to find I really really liked the Riding Solo, as well as all three of the other beers. This heightened my expectations for the pina, because now I knew 10 barrel brews some incredibly tasty beer, and I assumed Pina would be no exception, so I went back to the store to buy a 6-pack. Unfortunately I was wrong.<br>
<br>
L: Murky amber color with a thin-ish head. To me it looks like watered down apricot juice, but I'm colorblind, so take that with a grain of salt.<br>
S: In a word, unpleasant. Smells like rotting fruit. Not a super strong smell, but definitely not a good one.<br>
T: Not much taste. Slightly sweeter than an average beer of this abv. KInd of an unbalanced maltiness- I don't know just a sort of mediocre beer taste. Maybe a little bit of fruitiness on the tail end but if I didn't already know there was fruit juice in it, and hadn't sniffed it before taking a shwill, I probably would have never guessed this was a fruit beer.<br>
F: Kind of thin and watery, yet cloying aftertaste.<br>
O: Perhaps I'm grading it a bit harshly since I had such high expectations, but honestly its just not very good. The smell is pretty gross, and it really doesn't taste much like fruit. It's really a very mediocre beer. While I'd highly recommend trying all four 10 barrel beers I got int the variety pack, I don't see any reason anyone should bother with this beer.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,890 characters</span><br><br>","May 27, 2016",2.5,2.5,2.25,-34.6%,1.5,2.5,burdgod

This was a prime CANdidate for a Crack! &amp; inverted Glug in celebration of their arrival in PA. This produced two-plus fingers of foamy, fizzy, eggshell-white head that quickly fizzled its way out of existence. Color was a brilliant Straw-Yellow (SRM = &gt; 2, &lt; 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a light biscuit maltiness along with a lightly grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel was slightly thin. The taste was clean, lightly malty sweet, slightly grassy with Saaz hops. Finish was clean, semi-dry, mostly unobtrusive.

Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Tiny particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of grain, earth, grass, and hay aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit, earth, and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable, but there is nothing memorable about this one. <br>

The smell is of caramel/toffee with dark fruit (plum) and an earthy tone.<br>

The taste is of sweet caramel/toffee (hint of chocolate?) sweetness balanced by a bitterness that almost clashes in the initial taste.

3.71,53808,"From a 355 ml bottle (dated September 26, 2017) into a tulip. Reviewed from notes dated January 29, 2018.<br>
<br>
A-The beer is light honey in color with just a bit of haze when held in the light. A fat finger of nearly-white foam sits on top for about two minutes before fading out. The head is clingy and dense at first and leaves a chunk or two behind on the glass.<br>
<br>
S-The aroma is an interesting hoppy mixture of fruit and dry, raspy bitter notes. On the fruit side, I sniff lime, lemongrass, some berry notes that I can't quite place. There is not much in the way of malts here, just a hint of pale bread and crackers.<br>
<br>
T-The taste does not follow the smell as much as usual. There is a light sugary sweetness here and a bit of a paper flavor, both of which are likely a result of the beer's advanced age, but there is also a more pine-y and medicinal aspect to the hops. The beer still suggests lime and some berry fruit, but there is a hint of alcohol on the finish that amplifies the leafy side of the hops.<br>
<br>
M-The body is light to medium in weight with an almost creamy carbonation. Drinks easy.<br>
<br>
O-This beer sorta surprised me. I was expecting a run-of-the mill IPA, but Apocalypse packs some unique hop smells that you don't see everyday.<br><br><i class=""fas fa-align-left""></i> <span class=""muted"">1,242 characters</span><br><br>","Feb 06, 2018",3.75,3.75,3.75,-3.9%,4,3.5,spoony

Smell is earthy, funky and very prominent. In some ways the funky-ness reminds me of the smell of New Belgium's Rampant or Ranger (the old versions)  but much more prominent.  I'm a sucker for a prominent smelling beer and I do like that smell. So I am going to roll out a rare(for me these days) 4.75<br>

Aroma is strong and sweet with tropical fruit notes like guava and mango. <br>

The taste does not follow the smell but it is still very interesting.  I get more stone fruit out of the hop profile - maybe nectarine and peach up front with the tropical fruit in teh back along with a moderate bitterness and sticky sweet malt backdrop.  It is almost candy-like.  Almost too much but I think they pull it off really well so no down votes here.  The aftertaste is just the bitterness which I like in this kind of beer...  reminds you that it is still an IPA.<br>

Feel is more sticky than the east coast hazy IPAs I've been getting.  Clearly they use more malt so it has some weight to it -  common complaint on the hazies out here (but not from me - I like that).<br>
