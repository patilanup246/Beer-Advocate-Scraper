4.02,48619,"  rDev ,poured from half-growler (32 oz.) into pilsener glass; half-growler filled Saturday afternoon (Aug. 26) at Harvey Washbangers in College Station,
,
L:  95% clear copper, loads of amber in it, not quite crystal clear but close; pushes up thick fluffy head of beige foam that is stickier than glue; maintains full collar and most of a skin; lacing some on the way down but much more stick off the head than lace; shows moderate but consistent activity in the glass,
,
S:  grain, sour grain, almost medicinal at its coldest; as it warms, still hangs on to that light medicinality, you could almost call it herbal or earthy ... or a herbal/earthy mix thing of some kind; as it warms a bit more, it has a toasted bread with a little brown sugar or molasses ... so light but it's there,
,
T:  toasted malt, almost peaty at times, grain, toasted grain, some light earth bitterness, and best of all -- a growing oak-wood flavor in the aftertaste that seems to be building and building just a bit more each sip ... very subtle but very tasty,
,
F:  very midweight ale soft, almost fluffy, up front with loads of what feels like tiny prickly bubbles giving it a drinkable crisp finish; feels very sturdy and wonderful for both sipping or taking on a good medium-sized swallow,
,
O:  not shocking at all that (512) brewed up a heck of an altbier here ... glad I bought a half-growler, and the way that oak-wood aftertaste note builds and builds, I expect the last ounce to be better than the previous 31; the light hint of peat is interesting and arguably perfect for the style ... the peat is not wee heavy levels but enough to give it a good earthy feel; the well-conditioned lager side of this beer makes the mouthfeel a highlight, ","Aug 27, 2017",4.5,4.5,4,,3.75,4,Premo88

,
Showcases the tropical character of Mosaic well but eschews its superior subtle blueberry note. Pale malts balance out any hop bitterness. Mango, dried guava, papaya, floral hop flavour.,
,
Nice depth of flavour.,
,
Mouthfeel is refreshing. Smooth, wet, well-carbonated.,
,
Drinkable and enjoyable, though its hop pungency could be improved. I'd definitely take this over Community's Mosaic IPA in terms of the local market, but if you're brewing a Mosaic hopped IPA in Texas you'll always be in the shadow of Lone Pint's Yellow Rose, and this doesn't quite measure up. Definitely worth trying, and a beer I'd revisit if offered in sixers at a fair price.,

No surprises in aroma - fairly standard malt smell, with hints of tropical hops. Sadly, those hops don't show up as well in the taste, though they pop a little more as the beer approaches room temperature. The warmer the better for this one, though sadly the warmth also reveals a hint of imbalance between the desire to keep the alcohol low and get enough hop flavor.

edit: just had this on tap at the portland brewery and its absolute delicious, a totally different animal than the beer i reviewed here in denver. its dramatically different, juicier, fresher, way less sweet than i remember, and just a tip top ipa overall. i am bumping up some scores to reflect the perfect specimen at the brewery. i didnt find too much bitterness at all. i think it might not hold up super well, or got warm or something in transit to this market, but fresh at the brewery it was sensational!, ","Nov 24, 2015",3.75,3.75,4,-3.7%,3.75,4,StonedTrippin

Aroma of pineapple immediately lifts up to the olfactory, even at the pour; further analysis follows with stone fruits and more veiny pineapple. ,

Flavor is of sour and rindy tropical fruit to start, namely pineapple, getting the passion fruit here as well; as it drifts to the middle of the tongue the malts come into play as a pale counterpart, and then it finishes on white grapefruit and orange pith. ,

Feel is more chalky or pasty than I'd like, it sort of clings onto the mouth and doesn't let go easily even though I want it to.

Mini-growler fill from the Boise pub tonight... Poured into my new Teku... Beautiful pinkish orange with little head retention or lacing.. Bright REAL strawberry in the nose and on the palate.. lemon lactic notes freshen up the fruitiness.. Like an adult strawberry lemonade.. Strawberry beers are tough to get right and still pack enough fruit in... This one is done well... Would LOVE to see it in bottles at some point.,

3.01,125693,"  rDev ,12oz bottle, from a random grocery store in Sandpoint, Idaho.  Maybe a strange introduction to this brewery for me, but they was sellin' it, and I was buyin'.,
,
This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with just a few teensy floaties, and one finger of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly just bubbly dirty white head, which leaves some minor low-lying raincloud lace around the glass as things quickly settle.,
,
It smells of semi-sweet lemon and lime juice, bready pale malt, a soft stoney flintiness, and an ethereal and rather indistinct bitterness.  The taste is fairly sweet lemon/lime, perhaps a bit of those sugary candied orange slices for good measure, an underwhelmingly malty graininess, and a still hard to detect, wan, and let's just say leafy and earthy bitterness.,
,
The carbonation is pretty much inert for the most part, barely a frothy tickle to be bargained for, the body a so-so middleweight, but bolstered by that heady saccharine character, so of course it's smooth, smooth, smooth!  It finishes sweet, but on the downswing, as my palate, being North American, is now duly acclimatized, and I now find this not to be all that.,
,
Yeah, a simple fruit beer, one where the underlying brew is more or less obfuscated, in that it's hard to determine (or just not worth it) if it's even a lager or a blonde ale in there.  Kind of flat, overall, and not in the same league as the better domestic citrus radlers currently available, if you look around., ","Aug 08, 2015",3.5,3,2.5,,3.25,3,biboergosum

This one, for me, missed out on the rich, deep roasty aspect that I love in the Schwarzbier style.

 Surprised by how citrusy the aroma is. Very hops forward with orange zest, lemon and herbal dank that is IPA like. ,
Even more surprised by the taste, which is not only citrusy, but also juicy and sweet. Flavors of orange, pear and papaya contribute to an odd mesh of fruity sweetness. There is some peppery bitterness, but it is quite minimal and doesn’t provide so much balance. ,
First impressions are that this is more of an IPL considering how hoppy it is and for its light lager body. However, although it has a certain crispness to it, it seems to lack the dryness of a true pils. Neither an IPA, Pilsner, or IPL, perhaps they are stretching for a new style? A New England IPL? I’m all for American brewers pushing the boundaries and am not so rigid about style, however, I’m not sure they got this right., ","Dec 10, 2017",3.25,4,3.5,-4.2%,4,3.5,Gajo74

Great roasted malt aroma.  Flavor delivers the same, with a train load of roasted barley unloading in my mouth, complemented by a substantial dose of American hops.  At 7.5% this beer is bordering on imperial stout designation.  As promised, this beer is 100% American stout, no flavorings or other adjuncts, with the volume turned up just enough to command the attention of PNW beer drinkers (what, no coffee?  and not even 100 IBUs?), but not so much that it becomes boozy or syrupy.

Flavor is juicy (in the sense that fruit punch is juicy) as expected, but there's the familiar flavor of alpha bittering hops on the middle of the palate.  10 Barrel clearly wanted to for for a Summer Fruit beer that's actually a beer, when they clearly could have called it quits and just sold malt beverage alcopop.  Do hops taste good with passionfruit?  Maybe not.

Flavor is juicy, with mango and pineapple flavors present first up front, and then coating my palate.  This beer is juicy and sweet.  There's very little in the way of IBUs here (28), and the malt tastes very sweet, making for an almost shandy-like profile.  This has neither the dryness of an ale nor the crispness of a lager.

Appearance:  very deep, rich, dark brown with a murky haziness.  Head is a finger of creamy tan foam which has a good retention and leaves a great lace on the glass.  Quite attractive.,

Taste:  quite roasty with a bit of edge to it, there's also plenty of toastiness, nuttiness and biscuit to it.  Certainly not the worst stout out there, but I prefer an emphasis on the roasty, chocolatey flavors, whereas this seems more like a very dark brown ale or even a ""black amber"" -- which I really can't describe any other way.,

An unripe tangerine flavor rushes forward after a thin papaya start. The fruit lacks a freshness that just puts a dingy shadow over the whole thing like pineapple and banana left out to brown before eating. A woody pineapple rind flavor might be the culprit here. Medium dry finish leaves a lingering tart juice feel. Fruit beers are hard, pineapple beers especially. This is just an okay rendition.

The nose features an interplay between rich malt aromas that evoke dark fruits and a moist fruit cake and spicy herbal hop aromas. Malt and hop aromas are medium and fermentation aromas are medium to medium low. Pray for Snow has a very creamy texture and rolls across the tongue bringing traces of chocolate, figs, pear, grains, and nuts seasoned with spicy, floral, earthy, citrusy hop flavors. This is a subtle beer with medium to medium low hop flavors, medium medium to medium high malt flavors and medium low bitterness. Pray for Snow has medium low, very soft carbonation and a body just shy of medium. It is a good beer but for a winter ale, I prefer a little less subtlety., ","Mar 22, 2017",4,4.25,4,,4,4,pat61

S- First, sweet raspberry fruit hits, quickly followed by a touch of sour. There is a bit of medicinal flavor there with the raspberries resembling couch syrup a bit.,
,
T- Just a touch of the sweet raspberries hit the tongue first before the fruit turns tart and balances out. After the raspberries subside, the base beer's tartness is readily apparent. It is not too sour, but definitely the predominant flavor component. At the end of the drink, the raspberries return a bit to bring balance to the tartness.,

M- very highly carbonated and crushable, just like the name insinuates.,
,
Overall, this is a pretty good starter sour that still displays its fruit very well. The level of sour is satisfying, but gets a little strong in the middle of the drink. The fruit is a nice addition that definitely balances the tartness of the beer. This is a great beer for a hot summer day., ","Apr 21, 2017",3.5,3.5,3.5,-13.6%,3,3.75,boilermakerbrew

Pours a brilliant golden amber color with eggshell white bubbles that stick around. Smell is of caramel, slightly of toffee, along with a spice near the backend. Some citrus scents are prevalent as well. Taste reflects the smell. Initial caramel and toffee immediately lead into a citrusy hops bitterness, finishes with a lingering toffee taste.

Aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate, fresh and dried dark stone fruit, figs and a hint of vanilla. Flavor is dark toasted malt, fresh and dried plums, a hint of cherry, bourbon, vanilla and mild chocolate. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Hits all the expected malt and barrelling flavors for a barrel aged porter. The bourbon and dark fruit notes seem more forward than expected because of a lighter malt body. There is a quite nice vanilla infused dark fruit component that is very flavorful that lingers into the finish. A well made barrel aged porter that is a little unbalanced and boozy, but redeems itself with interesting flavors.

A-A normal pour produces about a finger of white foam. The retention is OK and the head leaves a little bit of fine lacing on the glass as I drink. The beer beneath the head is an unattractive yellow with a bit of haze to it. Some champagne-like carbonation is visible.,
,
S-The aroma is heavy on the cucumber, which has a seriously sweet flavor to it; almost like candy. I also sniff some lemon and lime tartness and just a hint of light funk that reminds me of cheese. Weird stuff, but not awful.,
,
T-The taste is also heavy on the cucumber. It is a bit fake tasting with a lot of candy-like sweetness to go with the cucumber flavors. The lemon-lime flavors remind me of Sprite or 7-Up and the only flavor that is close to normal beer is the mild lactic acidity that fades to a grainy finish. ,
,
M-The beer is light and effervescent on the palate. Carbonation is fine and bubbly. Like soda.,
,
O-The can says this beer is trying to introduce people to sours and ride the wave of popularity for sour beers, but this stuff hardly tastes like beer.

3.68,45496,"  rDev ,One of the beers in a mixed pack from 10 Barrel that I picked up.  I'm wondering about the name... isn't Schwarzbier a lager?  Why call it an ale?  I've always wondered that about Dead Guy, too.  I personally like it when breweries in this area of the country branch out and brew interesting lagers; if anything I'm more likely to grab one off the shelf if it looks different than the run of the mill ales around it.,
,
It pours dark brown but allows more light through than most brews of this color.  Not much head faded quickly and leaves scant lace.  Looks like black coffee to me, actually.,
,
Nose is pleasant but faint.  A big inhale yields something kind of bready, yeasty and sweet that reminds me of overnight waffles that my wife makes with yeast leavening, with syrup on top.,
,
Flavors are also pleasant and understated.  Bready malts with sweetness like molasses and faintly earthy hops.  Low carbonation and light body is a good mouthfeel match to the flavors.  This is the only non-IPA in the mixed pack from 10 Barrel, and it's a nice change of pace from the hops. (But Joe IPA was my favorite overall.),
,
10 Barrel must have been in a quirky mood when naming this beer.  Not only is ""Ale"" in the name puzzling to me since I believe this is a lager, a play on ""sinister"" doesn't fit either.  This is a mild-mannered, easy going drink that would play nice with a variety of food., ","May 15, 2015",3.75,3.5,3.75,,3.5,3.75,josiahschlender

2.21,230291,"  rDev ,I saw this at the store and was really excited because a pineapple/passionfruit beer sounds really tasty and interesting so I bought the variety 12 pack which said it included 3 bottles each of the IPA, Apocalypse IPA, Sinistor black ale, and the seasonal beer. I assumed the seasonal beer would be the Pina, but when I got home and opened the box, it turned out to be the Riding Solo APA instead, which I guess must have been the spring seasonal release. So I was really disappointed to not have the Pina, but was very pleasantly surprised to find I really really liked the Riding Solo, as well as all three of the other beers. This heightened my expectations for the pina, because now I knew 10 barrel brews some incredibly tasty beer, and I assumed Pina would be no exception, so I went back to the store to buy a 6-pack. Unfortunately I was wrong.,
,
L: Murky amber color with a thin-ish head. To me it looks like watered down apricot juice, but I'm colorblind, so take that with a grain of salt.,
S: In a word, unpleasant. Smells like rotting fruit. Not a super strong smell, but definitely not a good one.,
T: Not much taste. Slightly sweeter than an average beer of this abv. KInd of an unbalanced maltiness- I don't know just a sort of mediocre beer taste. Maybe a little bit of fruitiness on the tail end but if I didn't already know there was fruit juice in it, and hadn't sniffed it before taking a shwill, I probably would have never guessed this was a fruit beer.,
F: Kind of thin and watery, yet cloying aftertaste.,
O: Perhaps I'm grading it a bit harshly since I had such high expectations, but honestly its just not very good. The smell is pretty gross, and it really doesn't taste much like fruit. It's really a very mediocre beer. While I'd highly recommend trying all four 10 barrel beers I got int the variety pack, I don't see any reason anyone should bother with this beer., ","May 27, 2016",2.5,2.5,2.25,-34.6%,1.5,2.5,burdgod

Tons of caramel and toffee. Hints of chocolate along with some dark fruits. Some black cherry is there. The malts shine. The flavors basically follow the nose with a hop bite. Not much hop flavor, but solid hop bitterness. Mild hints of pine and citrus in the mix. The malts still shine and steal the show. More caramel and toffee along with some chocolate.

Really aggressive/resinous on bitterness, but still has nice malt balance. A very enjoyable offering., ","Jan 14, 2017",4,4,3.5,,3.5,4,superspak

Serving type: 12 oz can into a tulip glass. 2017 vintage.,
,
Pours a deep ebony black, with dark cola colored edges when held up to light. Mocha colored head that dissolves into a perfect unbroken circle of bubbles that persists throughout the drink. This is a beautiful looking beer, right on par for the style of Russian Imperial.,
,
Initial smell is of upfront whiskey, dark chocolate, roasted malt, milk chocolate, subtle coffee grounds, subtle coconut, with a a subtle dark fruit aroma (prune like). As the beer warms, an almost honey like sweetness starts to permeate the aroma. Residual mocha-like sweetness and coffee grounds become more apparent as the beer warms.,
,
Taste reflects the smell. Initial moderate whiskey flavors lead into a pleasant roasted malt/coffee ground flavor, whiskey flavors persist throughout the drink. Milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and roasted malt characteristics intermingle throughout the drink. Dark fruit flavors are more apparent during retronasal though not through the drink. Finishes with a lingering flavor of both light whiskey and dark chocolate. Reminds me of a Hershey dark chocolate bar that's been soaking in whiskey for a few hours. Delicious.,
,
Feel is thick, viscous, chewy, carbonation fits the heavier handed flavors and aromas of this beer. Overall, this is a great beer with great whiskey and dark chocolate aromas and flavors.

S:  hoppy ... green hops, grassy, a little lime ... citrus note is strong, grapefruit ... yes, as it warms, more and more grapefruit; biscuit malt under the thick layer of hops, very subtle,

,
T:  almost 1:1 following the nose with a minor adjustment -- a little more tart earthy flavor and toasted cranberries and a little less fingernail polish remover; as it warms and the palate adjusts, a bit of raspberry and blackberry, the more tart ones that haven't found their sweetness yet; as it warms more, some sweetness shows up just often enough to really make this tasty ... it's like those few grains of salt or sugar that bring out the flavors even more,

O:  wonderful ... a treat of a beer for my particular tastes buds, for it's very reminiscent of a Flanders red or oud bruin with the nice toasted malt flavors blending into the sour flavors, and I love those styles and that mix; when those toasted cranberries offer up some sweetness, my goodness!  you get some raspberry/blackberry flavor and want to start drinking it like it's a 3% kriek lambic.

,
Seriously though. It likes like just about every other milk stout you see, and that's not a bad thing. The nose is rather innocuous. I honestly wasn't expecting much after the nose, but I was amazingly surprised. Excellent lactose, chocolate, coffee flavors up front and delicious cinnamon on the backbone. After a moment or two the backbone evolves with the pepper flavor that balances heat and flavor in just the perfect way that leaves your mouth feeling full and vaporous.

$5.50 / 6.5 oz.,
,
Notes: Listed at 8.2% ABV... not sure what year it is. The barrel actually brings out the pecan in comparison to the regular, unless of course there's actually double pecans in use - I tasted them side by side. Bourbon and oak are found in the aroma along with a mild dark roastiness. The flavor follows with an additional touch of fruit and chocolate and milky coffee; and then finishes with fruit, cocoa, a hint of alcohol (Bourbon) and coconut. Medium bodied with a median carbonation. It's unlike any beer I've ever tasted, and I've had other pecan beers before. Was it worth the cost? Probably when you consider that it's a beer you sip at rather than just drink down; and that there are added costs in the ingredients (mainly the pecans) to get it to where it is. In any case it's unique, and probably worth trying based on that alone, but I'd suggest you look for the standard version as well so that you can compare the two., ","Jan 20, 2017",4,4,4.25,,4,4.25,NeroFiddled

,
A:  Pours a dark black color that is nearly opaque.  A one finger tan head forms with good retention initially and light lace.  That recedes in a second, and not surprisingly considering the ABV. ,
S:  Rich and deep dark chocolate that lasts forever.  Very sweet up front, with caramel/toffee like malts.  I don't get any barrel character in the nose, but dark chocolate and malts are very good.  If a little simplistic.,
T:  Like the nose, this is dark chocolate all the way.  Rich and sweet with a bit of caramel malts in there.  Hardly any roast to speak of, just almost entirely chocolate malts.  There is a touch of tannin like twang towards the end when this warms, but I was hard pressed to tell there was any barrel aging here.,
M/O:  A big full body, but not overly viscous at all.  Given the strength and body that is impressive.  Appropriately carbonated and smooth at the same time.  There is a bit of heat, and very much a slow sipper.  While that is to be expected, it is more of a one snifter per sitting every once in a while. ,
,
A big stout for sure.  The barrel is beyond subtle here, and almost nonexistent.  The stout mostly consists of big chocolate and light caramel malts.  While not bad in anyway, and enjoyable for what it is.  Just to simplistic and to big for me to come back to often., ","May 01, 2016",4,4,3.5,-14.6%,3.75,3.5,champ103

3.82,45496,"  rDev ,Appearance - Pours black with cola brown edging. The head is khaki colored and peaks at just under a finger's width. Retention is average at best, giving way to a broken layer of surface suds. Lacing is small and spotty with little stick.,
,
Smell - Light notes of roasted malt and some cola-like sweetness. Hints of milk chocolate.,
,
Taste - Follows the nose. General malt sweetness with hints of cola, chocolate, and very light coffee roast. Subtle notes of fruity esters and maybe even a hint of vanilla and anise in there. A light, 'brightly dark' flavor profile, if that makes any sense.,

Mouthfeel - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Lightly silky texture, delivering a smooth, easy drinking experience.,

Overall - Pretty good black lager / scharzbier, especially condsidering the style. It's a difficult style to pull off, IMO, because it doesn't quite excel in any particular area.

This tastes really great...very fresh and clean tasting.  I really like the hops-to-malt balance...just as one seems about to nudge in front, the other reels it in.  Definite pine showing up here which I REALLY like in an IPA.  Must be some Mosaic or Simcoe in there.  There is quite a bit of maltiness here and sometimes that's off-putting for me but it just makes this one...delicious.  My first beer from 11 Below.

A little sweet on the front end, then the barrel properties attack your palate.  Every now and then, the alcohol seeps thru.  For such a big beer on the front, the alcohol dries it out at the end.

,
On-draught.,
,
HEAD: ~1cm wide. White in colour. Supple. Decent thickness and creaminess. Above average (~3 minute) retention. Nice even lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head recedes.,
,
BODY: Translucent murky dark copper. Nontransparent. I see no yeast/lees within; it's a clean looking brew.,
,
Appears adequately carbonated.,
,
AROMA: Milky/whoppery malts, cream, pale English malts, butterscotch, floral and herbal hop notes, buttery toffee. No yeasty notes are detectable.,
,
Not boozy.,
,
A pleasant aroma of mild strength, though I do have concerns about potential diacetyl off-flavour based on the buttery notes so prominent in the aroma.,
,
TASTE & TEXTURE: Very buttery and milky, with a sickly English pale malt backbone corrupted by the buttery/butterscotch-redolent diacetyl that dominates the brew. Light floral and herbal hop character is in there too, along with some toffee. ,
,
Has a light creamy feel on the palate. Medium-bodied. Has an okay thickness that doesn't really support the malt backbone all that well. Overcarbonated.,
,
Too sweet overall; definitely imbalanced even though the build boasts fair cohesion. The flavours showcased here just really don't appeal to me personally; maybe an English ale purist would find more value in this brew than I do.,
,
Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour. Not a complex, subtly executed, or nuanced brew by any stretch.,
,
OVERALL: Not 512's strongest work. I don't care much for this one in particular, and wouldn't get it again. It'll be a chore to finish this.,

,
Served from a cask into a nonic at Banger's in Austin, TX. Cost was $7.50 USD per 16 oz.,
,
6.8% ABV.,
,
HEAD: 1.5 fingers in height. Creamy, full, and thick, with a soft appearance and an even consistency. Supple. No lacing adheres to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. Retention is average (~2 minutes).,
,
BODY: Opaque dark black. No yeast/lees are visible within.,
,
Looks nice for a porter, but it doesn't have any unique or special characteristics. Appears undercarbonated (a seeming casualty of its unfortunate cask dispensing).,
,
I'm optimistic going in.,
,
AROMA: Muted dark malts, faint caramelized pecan, a faint kiss of fruit (I guess cherry), and buried roast.,
,
Nowhere near as evocative/expressive as it should be. Aromatic intensity is quite light.,
,
Again, this seems worse for having been cask-dispensed.,
,
TASTE: Dark malt sweetness, faint chocolate, a kiss of coconut, a bit of faint cherry and vague dark fruit. Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour.,
,
Has adequate complexity and subtlety, but this can't compete on those terms with the best expressions of the style.,
,
TEXTURE: Undercarbonated, thin, smooth, wet, unrefreshing. Suits the taste okay, but doesn't elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours.,
,
OVERALL: Downable, but not an improvement on 512's Pecan Porter or a better expression of a porter overall. I wouldn't buy it again, but it is above average (i.e. I'd take this over your run of the mill Sam Adams variety pack porter). Worse off for having been dispensed from a cask.,

A:  Pours a perfectly clear, light bronze/yellow color.  A two finger dense head forms with good retention.  Lace left all the way down the glass.,
S:  Baked bread is up front.  A very nice biscuit/toasted malt aroma.  A light earthy hoppy aroma that becomes slightly grassy, even spicy in the finish.  Simple, but very nice.,
T:  Like the nose, this is very simple and to the point.  Baked bread, toasted malts mainly.  Again, finishes with a touch of earthy /grassy/spicy hops.  A bitterness builds a little as this warms.,
M/O:  A light body with excellent carbonation.  Crisp and smooth at the same time.  Super clean and dry as well.  Beautifully simple, which makes it all the more enjoyable.  Something I want to keep coming back to again and again.,
,
Very subtle and simple, but so enjoyable.  512 has always been that way.  Just straight forward and to the point.  Some other breweries could learn from them.  This probably won't hit with many people here, but it is a very well made Export Lager.  Well done., ","Sep 14, 2016",4.25,4.25,4.25,,4,4,champ103

Very drinkable, showcasing Cabernet rather well, though I don't know that the base tripel is all that impressive itself. Still, I wouldn't have thought Cabernet would play so well in a tripel. Definitely a beer I'd buy by the sixer if offered at a $12-13 price.,

Pours a creamy pale khaki head atop an opaque black body. Head retention is poor; this dies within 30 seconds (if that).,
,
Aroma suggests a scintilla of burnt malt, some dark malt sweetness, floral hops, herbal hops, and evergreen hop aromatics. Pleasant and inviting, seemingly marrying dark malt sweetness and hop bitterness to good effect. Aromatic intensity is average.,
,
Tastes of evergreen/faint pine, floral hops, and subdued dark malt sweetness...I suspect the malt bill is mainly pale malt with dark malt or carafa in there more for colour than flavour... that's kind of cheating in terms of Cascadian dark ales. Hints of bready malt, ale yeast esters, and resin.,
,
Creamy, smooth, wet, medium to full-bodied. Well-carbonated.,
,
Depth of flavour is limited, as is hop pungency.,
,
A solid Cascadian dark ale if a subdued one; dial up the hop pungency, scale back the 2-row committing more to the carafa, and keep this level of balance and we'll have a real contender on our hands.,

,
A-The beer is light honey in color with just a bit of haze when held in the light. A fat finger of nearly-white foam sits on top for about two minutes before fading out. The head is clingy and dense at first and leaves a chunk or two behind on the glass.,
,
S-The aroma is an interesting hoppy mixture of fruit and dry, raspy bitter notes. On the fruit side, I sniff lime, lemongrass, some berry notes that I can't quite place. There is not much in the way of malts here, just a hint of pale bread and crackers.,
,
T-The taste does not follow the smell as much as usual. There is a light sugary sweetness here and a bit of a paper flavor, both of which are likely a result of the beer's advanced age, but there is also a more pine-y and medicinal aspect to the hops. The beer still suggests lime and some berry fruit, but there is a hint of alcohol on the finish that amplifies the leafy side of the hops.,
,
M-The body is light to medium in weight with an almost creamy carbonation. Drinks easy.,
,
O-This beer sorta surprised me. I was expecting a run-of-the mill IPA, but Apocalypse packs some unique hop smells that you don't see everyday., ","Feb 06, 2018",3.75,3.75,3.75,-3.9%,4,3.5,spoony

On draft, OB had a great, deeper-than-expected color, with a decent but not excessive head. Having been aware of the beer already, was disappointed in the relative lack of flavor notes -- didn't pick up much of the toffee/caramel that others have mentioned. It's possible that my taste buds were having an off day, but I found this, even for an amber, to be a little tamer than my preference. I'll circle back on this rating another time -- sometimes my initial evals of ambers and lagers can be overly cruel.

A:  Pours a copper/amber/reddish color. A two finger white head forms with good retention initially, and a bit of spotty lace.,
S:  Big buttery aromas up front.  Some fruity esters linger.  Pears, apples, along with some light wood.  Not bad, the buttery notes through me off a bit.  Though I think that is from the wine barrel.  ,
T:  Again, a substantial buttery character up front.  I am not that well verst in Cab, let alone wines in general.  Though, considering I have never encountered buttery diacetyl in regular 512 Tripel, I am thinking this comes from the wine barrel.  Fruity esters come next.  Pears and apples are apparent, along with a slight tartness and acidity.,
M/D:  A medium body that is effervescent and super crisp.  I love the carbonation here.  Appropriately weighty as well.  Easy to drink, even with the buttery character.  Something I can come back to with ease.,
,
I am almost positive the buttery character comes from the wine barrel.  It is not so much a detriment, just not what I was really expecting.  Though once I get use to it, the esters come out and are great.  I think the alcohol is well hidden as well.  Overall, very interesting, and something I will come back to.

This was a prime CANdidate for a Crack! & inverted Glug in celebration of their arrival in PA. This produced two-plus fingers of foamy, fizzy, eggshell-white head that quickly fizzled its way out of existence. Color was a brilliant Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a light biscuit maltiness along with a lightly grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel was slightly thin. The taste was clean, lightly malty sweet, slightly grassy with Saaz hops. Finish was clean, semi-dry, mostly unobtrusive. Once more, at just 5.0% ABV, I could sit around & crush these over the course of an afternoon., ","Jun 21, 2016",3,3.75,3.5,,3.5,3.75,woodychandler

First off, this is an excellent stout. Incredibly balanced and not an overwhelming maltiness you expect in a stout. Good head that retains a small ring all the way through til the end and leaves lots of lacing. Refreshing mouth feel. Explosion of flavors roasted barley, coffee, sweetness, and finishes with the perfect amount of slight spice and chile flavor that leaves you craving more.

Taste - Follows the nose. Citrus hops with lesser notes of pine. Malts are distant, but hints of roast and chocolate do peak through briefly. ,

The palate opens clean, mildly bitter and with moderate hop flavor. Mild melon, peach, pink lady apple ( especially the crisp and refreshing aspects) up front followed by a mildly sweet mid palate with honey, a little sugar and fruit juice. The finish is impeccable, clean, refreshing, fruity with just enough hop oil and hop bitterness to tie all the aspects together. Soft and creamy carbonation make this quite enjoyable as well.

Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Tiny particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of grain, earth, grass, and hay aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit, earth, and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable, but there is nothing memorable about this one. ,

3.5,95838,"  rDev ,this beer is going to take over the world. well, maybe not the world world, but some segment of it. its intended to be a cheap and higher quality alternative to the american adjunct lager, and i think it fills that role as well as any beer could. there is no comparing this to the BMC yellow stuff, not at all, its leagues better. that said, against some of the better craft lagers out there, it leaves a bit to be desired, but i think its happy camping itself out right in the middle of the two types, and it fills that void expertly. a touch sweet, but not cheap tasting, tastes like grain and lager yeast, not adjuncts and metal, so there it goes. its also got just the lightest european type hop profile to it in the finish, gassy and dry, which i really like. cool college kids will play part games with this beer, lonely divorced dudes will stock their fridges with it and watch sports in boxer shorts slamming this, blue collar folks in the right cities will tailgate with it, its cool for a craft(ish) beer to fill that niche dont you think? how far we have come! until now i have only seen single cans, but i have to imagine a 30 pack is in the works. great marketing, decent brew., ","Nov 24, 2015",3.5,3.5,3.5,,3.5,3.5,StonedTrippin

3.59,65536,"  rDev ,I had this on-tap recently and adored it, so I jumped at the chance to nab a 64 oz growler fill today. Reviewed live as a milk stout.,
,
Served chilled into a pilsner glass in Austin, TX, and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Expectations are high. The weight and angle of the growler necessitated an unusually vigorous pour.,
,
No bubble show forms as it's poured.,
,
HEAD: 4 fingers wide. Gorgeous tan colour, great creaminess. Full, thick, and supple, with a soft overall appearance and an even consistency. Leaves a webby coating of lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes. Retention is excellent - easily 10 minutes. This is damned impressive.,
,
BODY: As you'd expect, it's an opaque solid jet black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.,
,
Overall, it's a great looking milk stout. There are of course ways it could be improved - a darker richer head, a bubble show, a better complexion - but that's nitpicking.,
,
AROMA: The subtle ancho chile characteristics are fantastic, and the chile is just as present as it should be. The lactose sugar, dark malt, and chocolate malt-induced sweetness isn't too overt; in fact, this may be one of the more restrained milk stout aromas I've ever encountered. The roasted barley is nowhere near as prominent as it ought to be.,
,
Overall, the aroma promises a balanced no-frills milk stout with some interesting chile character. Aromatic intensity is mild at most.,
,
No off-notes, hop character, or yeast character is detectable. This is certainly to style.,
,
TASTE: Not quite as good as I remember it being on-draught.,
,
The chile heat in the third act is the first element I notice, but it's present from the early second act - it's just so subtly executed. It does grow on you and intensify as the beer comes to temperature, which I love. The chile heat isn't bad by any means - on par with mild ancho. I can't see anyone needing a second beverage whilst drinking this.,
,
Predictably, dark/schwarz malts, chocolate malts, and lactose sugar fill out the malt backbone and lend it sweetness, but this isn't anywhere near as sweet as I expected, and is certainly on the tamer side for the style. Added complexity comes from cream, a hint of marshmallow, and a touch of roast. I crave more roasted barley, and constructively this build could do with still more intricacy - why not coffee, hazelnut, caramelized pecan, actual chocolate, cocoa nibs, vanilla bean, etc. It's adequately complex, but there's room for more.,
,
The blend of admittedly basic dark malt sweetness with the subtle chile is just damned effective. There's an elegance to this beer's straightforward quality and balance.,
,
The flavour duration is long, largely as result of the subtle chile heat that lingers into the aftertaste, encouraging another sip. Flavour depth and intensity are average or above average. This is absolutely a cohesive brew, and I do find that it tastes like a gestalt whole; it's hard to imagine removing anything. And the chile doesn't feel forced into the otherwise standard milk stout build at all.,
,
I'm really enjoying this one, but my biggest issue is with the light vinegar that accompanies the chile - though I don't remember this characteristic from the draught version.,
,
TEXTURE: Smooth, creamy, wet, and medium-bodied, with modest thickness. It's not a syrupy, sticky, or viscous mess like it could be. It's unrefreshing, but then no good milk stout isn't. Well-carbonated. Has adequate weight and heft on the palate, but it's not boozy. The alcohol is well-disguised.,
,
OVERALL: Easily the most memorable milk stout I've had this year so far, and frankly I doubt I'll see it beaten. For my money, this crushes market imposters from other states like Left Hand's Milk Stout or Odell's Lugene's, but I'm not sure whether I prefer this or Lakewood's The Temptress in the Texan market. In any case, it's high praise when a milk stout is mentioned in the same vein as those other quality offerings, and I'll definitely plan on having this again. This growler fill has numbered days, gentlemen. This is worth seeking out when in Texas, and manages to attain a high drinkability even with the presence of chile heat - which is very tough to do. This is absolutely one of 512's best beers.,
,
B,
,
***,
02.05.15: 2nd impressions from the same growler:,
,
The chile is muted when this is served cold, and the sweetness takes over to its detriment. Needs time to warm.,
,
Though it has (already) deteriorated somewhat in the growler, it remains a tasty brew with subtle chili heat and aptly high sweetness. Roasted barley presence would be nice, but overall it's pretty well balanced for what it is and I definitely like it.,
,
Its high sweetness does limit its drinkability, but it's easily one of the best milk stouts available in Texas and in the USA (based on what I've had). Well worth trying.,

,
I live in Petaluma; I've been drinking 101 North beers for years, even going to their tap room.  I've ordered it on tap from many locations around the north bay and watch the bar tender struggle with pouring a good glass.  The beers have been over-carbonated since the beginning, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was just a one-time mistake from a small brewer, but it's been YEARS of this.  It's just poor brewing at this point and it's no longer acceptable.,
,
Additionally, every time I go to the tap room, they ONLY have Heroine and Golden Naked available for sale in bombers (or any size).  I've been a few times over the last 3 years, and there's never anything else for sale.  Either their tap room employees are clueless or the person running the business is.  ,

Mostly small bubbles but an aggressive pour will give you a thick foamy head with EXCELLENT lacing.  Good looking beer.  ,
,
Smell is very good, some good balance and depth here.  Not a hop bomb but appropriately hoppy.  Citrus, tropical and floral hops.  Sweet malts provide a nice balance on the back end.  ,
,
Taste is really excellent.  Much stronger than I expected especially based on the smell, the flavors really step it up to where it's kind of bold.  Hoppier than you'd expect based on the aroma.  It's got excellent citrus flavor, tangerine, blood orange and maybe a bit of clementine.  This follows a nice sweet fresh baked bread flavor provided by the grains.  At the end is some bitterness from the hops again, sort of like a bitter citrus pith garnish.  ,
,
Mouthfeel is good as well.  It's surprisingly light on the tongue because it does have a nice long lingering flavor.  Maybe a little less carbonated than it could be, but not much.  Great balance.  Starts of with a bit of citrus hoppyiness going to some sweet bread and buttery in the middle than a bitter finish that's fairly dry.  Great drinkability.  This is a beer that's meant for a growler.  Great beer I hope it's always there when I go to Tenth District.  Great addition to the community., ","Dec 01, 2015",4.25,4.25,4.25,,4.25,4.25,AndyAvalanche

3.35,75401,"  rDev ,Foeder II: Brewed Apr 2013 / Bottled Feb 2015. Served cold into a goblet and allowed to warm over the course of consumption.,
,
Truncated notes below:,
,
HEAD: Full and luscious, with good thickness and a nice even consistency. Good complexion. Creamy and frothy. Retention is average; this lasts for only 2 minutes. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. ~1 inch wide.,
,
BODY: Oddly, it's an opaque solid black. Not an ink black or jet black, but rather dark. I see no yeast or hop sediment.,
,
It's strangely dark for a sour, but the head is promising. Appears adequately carbonated.,
,
AROMA: Has plenty of wild ale characteristics, with wild ale yeasts, an eclectic sourness which isn't limited to the usual lactobacillus - but rather showcases pediococcus shockingly well, faint oak barrel, and hints of muted cherry fruit. It does suffer a bit from a minor dampened cardboard note - giving it a musty and surprisingly dry aroma, but overall the pediococcus alone has me interested in this beer. It's more tart than sour, and it isn't even that tart; you'd think they'd commit more to that given the cherry note. In any case, I'd guess the sourness is around a 3/10 in terms of intensity just from the aroma.,
,
Aromatic intensity is average.,
,
TASTE: Pediococcus bacteria is in control here, giving it a mild sourness (~2/10 in terms of intensity) which sour fans will find wanting. Its 9% ABV is shockingly well concealed. The cherry is muted to its detriment, and it lacks sufficient tartness. Slightly acetic, though more of an acetic pie crust character on par with Rodenbach would do wonders. I find no brettanomyces funkiness. I'm doubting lactobacillus was used, but such usage would definitely improve this beer - both by giving it more sourness and by lending the mouthfeel a needed acidic smackiness.,
,
The barrel is in the background, but it doesn't really integrate well into the base. The abovementioned dampened cardboard note does make an appearance - a byproduct of oversoaked oak wood. But the oak itself lends nothing to improve the beer aside from a weak generic musty wood note that I suppose lends the build some cohesion.,
,
Not tart or sour enough to appease the discerning sour drinker, but the pediococcus is nice. Compared to the best beers in the style, it's rather shallow and simple, with a subpar balance. I do like it in a general sense, but it leaves much to be desired.,
,
TEXTURE: Slightly acetic and definitely of above average acidity. Unrefreshing, medium-bodied, oddly dry and musty, and smooth. A sharper tangier more acidic feel would help complement the sour notes nicely, and a more smacky texture would help play up the pucker factor.,
,
There's no harmony of texture to taste, but this isn't badly executed by any stretch. A bit overcarbonated, sure, but overall it does an okay job complementing the taste.,
,
OVERALL: Not a bad first foray into wild fermentation, but way off the mark if 512 is hoping to compete with Jester King or even Real Ale in the Austin, TX market. I'll have no trouble finishing the entire 750ml bottle by myself, and I imagine that imperceptible 9% ABV will catch up to me. I wouldn't buy this again, especially at its extortionate price relative to its (lack of) quality, but it shows definite promise in terms of what we can expect from 512's wild/sour efforts in the future. I do have to ask - why weren't the brettanomyces yeast and pediococcus bacteria added during primary fermentation, instead of after?,

a: Translucent orange with an inch thick white head which receded to thick even surface foam and dense lacing.,

s: Fruit cup with some strength.,

t: More pine than fruit, moderate hop bite draws attention over the malt and dry finish.,
,
m: Medium plus, very good body and carbonation tingle.,
,
o: Advertised as a NW coast IPA, not sure how that differs from your average west coast style but this one has more fruitiness with the pine.  A solid IPA on the higher end of the spectrum, just short of a double, and to my thinking better than the total rating it has here.

4.12,169502,"  rDev ,A:  Pours a dark and hazed reddish/orange color.  At first a two finger white head forms, but that fizzles out in a second and recedes to a ring that sticks throughout.  Not much lace to speak of.,
S:  The nose is great.  Musty yeast, tart fruits of cherries, grapes, and apples.  Even some citrusy orange rind.  This all intermingles with some light tannins and oak.  The Brett yeast, bacteria and wood all work really well here.,
T:  The oak tannins are a bit more prevalent and up front than the nose.  Up front is a litle sweet as well, but that fades as this warms and everything else takes over.  Less of that musty basement character that I love, but still present and builds as this warms.  Lightly tart fruits that follow the nose.  It just doesn't hit all the right notes perfectly like the nose.  Still very good anyway.,
M/O:  A light to medium body.  Incredibly effervescent and spritzy.  Tannins all over the place, which I really like.  Very enjoyable and easy to drink.  The 750ml will be gone in no time.  ,
,
I have typically found 512's sour or wild ales a bit one noted and not particularly interesting.  This is really well done though.  With two years in a wine barrel, this gets a little tannin heavy, but it does work with the yeast and bacteria.  Very much worth a try, and something I would recommend., ","Sep 02, 2015",4.25,3.75,4.25,,4.25,4,champ103

3.17,64765,"  rDev ,22oz Winter 2015 Seasonal Release from 10 Barrel; this one claims 7% ABV.  Served in pint glass.  Beer pours deep brown in color, tinged with red, fairly viscous, with negligible head formation.  Pretty clouded, too.  Malty aroma of seasonal fruits, maybe prunes?  Flavor drowns out those fruity notes with spicy ones.  And even the spicy, peppery flavor seems to blend in with what I would describe as an ethanol flavor.  Overall this beer is just not that great, but after a long day in the snow I'm thankful for it anyway., ","Dec 13, 2015",3.25,3.5,3.25,-12.7%,3.25,3,hreb

3.74,64765,"  rDev ,i agree with others that the nose is the best feature of this beer, grainy malty, but interesting, with a definite citrus and raw sugar thing going on, its a neat mix of smells, and out of the range of what i expected in a loose winter warmer category. i almost get a hint of whiskey through the lighter brown body, nice clarity and head retention as well. mildly sweet, but more of the molasses thing going on in terms of flavor than sugar, which i dig, and almost no appreciable spice profile to it, which sort of bends the rules a little bit, also to my personal liking. caramel flavor, like dessert caramel not caramel malt, soft and buttery, kind of melts in the mouth too. grain driven all the way, and where spice might normally fall, there is a bitter orange peel flavor and even a hint of spruce in there, must be whatever hops they selected for it. the alcohol is well hidden, and there is a residual biscuity thing going on thats comforting to me for some reason. my only critique is the utter lack of body. its thin to a fault, and even peppery carbonation cant save it. i really was put off by it, and all the wintery delights in the nose and taste are rendered less effective in setting the tone for the season. it needs body badly, and it seems like a flaw here. still, i love the way it smells and enjoyed it quite well, more weight to it next year would put it near the top of its class., ","Nov 24, 2015",3,3.75,3.75,,4,3.75,StonedTrippin

Hell, I am a media whore, giving interviews & having my picture taken at a rate that rivals the Kardashians & I would love for the cash register to begin pinging in my favor. Get over it. Better beer is on the uptick and as more people discover more & different favors, the demand will also increase. This will lead to interest from the corporate sector. It happens. Me?

I am coming to embrace the Pop! of the cap since a favorite Countian of mine takes them to do all sorts of arts & crafts things, including the creation of a cap-mail vest! Once completed, I went with a gentle pour IAW my New Year's resolution. An in-glass swirl raised two-plus fingers of foamy, rocky, tawny head with modest retention. Color was a pretty Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity, enticing a visit from The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas & Croesus, enabling their passion. The nose held a biscuity maltiness that offset the strong grapefruit aromas from the hops & I was intrigued. Mouthfeel was medium, right in Baby Bear's wheelhouse of just right. The taste was bitter & citrusy, especially with grapefruit, but it was not as aggressive as some that I have encountered of late. Instead, it was offset by a dry, biscuity maltiness that was also just right. It seemed to me like an early AIPA that bridges the gap between EIPAs & more current versions of AIPAs that push up against DIPAs. Phew! Follow me? It was hoppy without being super hoppy, but enough that the malt was secondary. Finish was dry, but not astoundingly bitter. It was a very enjoyable beer & I urge you to get past the noise & try it for yourself., ","Jul 11, 2017",3.75,4,3.75,,3.75,4,woodychandler

,
From the bottle: ""Bend. Oregon"".,
,
I was anxious to get started, so following the Pop! of the cap, I performed an aggro pour. This resulted in the unbidden creation of two-plus fingers of solid, foamy, rocky, tawny head that looked like meringue atop the beer. Color was solid Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a mélange of qualities, including tropical fruit, cattiness, grapefruit & even some pine. Oooh! This makes my hophead self VERY happy. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste began with a strong tropical fruitiness, then slowly gave way to the grapefruit bitterness as well as the cattiness noted on the nose. I did not taste pine, so maybe I was hallucinating when I smelt it on the nose. Good golly, but it was leaving some incredibly dense, sticky lacing behind as I drank it! Finish was dry & bitter, more towards grapefruit & cattiness than tropical fruit, but it was fine by me since it satiated my hops jones for the time being., ","Jul 11, 2017",3.75,4,4,-0.8%,4.25,3.75,woodychandler

Poured into a big, thick bavarian Stein (too lazy to wash last night's 22 oz pilsner glass). It produces a robust and near-invincible head, with a strangely appealing ""wet"" aroma to it. Right away, you notice how chewy it is - an absolute cloying wallop of roasted toffee flavor  deep-throats your mouth, followed by notes of burning alcohol, fresh-grated nutmeg, and apricot. The hops lend more to the aftertaste and the mouthfeel than they do the flavor; there's a slightly astringent, cottony note to them. ,

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not getting a lot of hops out of it as I pour it. Fresh beer aroma with hops, yes, but nothing specific. Very hazy golden body. Frothy bright white head. Putting my nose to it there's more. It's resinous, and what a lot of people describe as dank (dank:  [daNGk]  adjective  disagreeably damp, musty, and typically cold). I do get a kind of a smell of marijuana though, although I think they're using the word wrong. Citrusy, and with some pine as well. The citrus is probably mainly grapefruit, but I think there's some orange as well. It's not a bad aroma, but it's not as bright as I'd expected. Moving forward, the flavor follows. There's an added light note of mintiness to the hops, and the malt is biscuity and toasty. I was hoping the ""dank"" character would have followed but it comes off more as a kind of vegetal note, kind of like the stem of a tomato-plant - at least more so that than marijuana. ""Apocalypse""? I think not. Decent enough? OK. It's floral as well, and the malt has a slight edge of honey and caramel to it. It's nicely balanced with a stiff bitterness, and it finishes dry, grassy, piney, and somewhat mineralish. Medium leaning toward medium-light in body and ""fizzy"". As it warms it improves and I'm finding an almost peach or apricot-like note, and more soft grapefruit., ","Feb 21, 2017",3.75,4,3.75,-2.3%,3.75,3.75,NeroFiddled

,
Pours a very hazy deep orange color, fairly turbid on pour, 3 finger bone white fluffy head that leaves nice lacing.,
,
Aroma is strong and sweet with tropical fruit notes like guava and mango. ,
,
The taste does not follow the smell but it is still very interesting.  I get more stone fruit out of the hop profile - maybe nectarine and peach up front with the tropical fruit in teh back along with a moderate bitterness and sticky sweet malt backdrop.  It is almost candy-like.  Almost too much but I think they pull it off really well so no down votes here.  The aftertaste is just the bitterness which I like in this kind of beer...  reminds you that it is still an IPA.,
,
Feel is more sticky than the east coast hazy IPAs I've been getting.  Clearly they use more malt so it has some weight to it -  common complaint on the hazies out here (but not from me - I like that).,
,
Overall this is a solid beer that you should seek out.  Great balance between hops, sweetness and bitterness.  Very well done., ","May 03, 2017",4,4,4.25,,4.25,4.5,digboy

S: Moderate aromas of tropical/passionfruit, tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit rind, and herbal hops over the top of light aromas of biscuit, toasted, and caramel malts.,

T: Upfront there are moderate flavors of biscuit, caramel, and toasted malts with a light to moderate amount of caramel sweetness. That is followed by slightly stronger than moderate flavors of tropical/passionfruit, tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit rind, and herbal hops which contribute a slightly heavier than moderate amount of aggressive bitterness which lingers for quite a while.,
,
M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Light to moderate amounts of dryness in the finish.,

Smell - Malty, with light brown sugar notes, nutty pecan and a distant powdered cocoa character.,

Overall - A mighty fine porter, but didn't quite live up to the expectations that the hype train behind it had bestowed upon me.

It has a light sweetness up front but dries out by the end. The hop flavors are medium high, the hop bitterness is medium high and lingers, the malt is medium and provides an initial light sweetness to balance the hop bitterness and brighten the fruit flavors. the body and carbonation are medium.

4.15,53808,"  rDev ,Poured from bomber into a pint glass,
,
Appearance – The beer pours an orange amber color with a two finger head of white foam.  The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.,
,
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of a grapefruit citrus and some sweeter fruit of a tropical nature (papaya, tangerine and mango) with some harvest fruit of apple and peach as well.  Along with the nice fruity smells, comes a bit of a pine and grassy smell as well as some hay.  Overall the aroma is quite nice.,
,
Taste – The taste begins with a great grapefruit hop taste that is mixed with the sweetness of tropical fruits and harvest fruits that were present in the nose.  There is a little bit of a doughiness upfront which fades as the taste advances and is replaced by some toasted bready tastes mixed with a little bit more fruitiness.  While the fruitiness increases a bit in intensity, hop flavors of resinous pine and a bit of grass come to the tongue, leaving one with a rather flavorful and smooth hopped up taste to linger on the tongue.,
,
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the medium side in terms of thickness and chewiness with a carbonation level that is rather average.  For the mix of fruity, dank and lightly toasted flavors the feel is fantastic and makes for one easy drinking but robust drinker.,
,
Overall – I rather enjoyed this brew.  It has a ton of different flavors that all melded together well. Along with the great nose and feel, the combination of attributes made for a very nice drinking brew., ","Jun 21, 2016",4,3.75,4,,4.25,4.25,Darkmagus82

3.66,170128,"  rDev ,Bottled on 12/14/16. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours golden hazy burnt golden with a fluffy white head that falls leaving very nice retention and sticky lacing. The aromas have a nice balance between citrus and tropical notes. The citrus aromas seem to have the edge though. Lots of orange. Some bready malts in the mix. The flavors are citrus forward. Tons of orange along with some grapefruit. Hints of pine and fresh grass. Malts do their thing, but the hops shine. Solid hop flavor and hop bitterness. It's juicy and dry at the same time. Alcohol basically goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's medium-bodied with moderate to active carbonation. It's fluffy and very smooth.,

4.13,53808,"  rDev ,Bought a sixer of this a while back, liked it. Found it in the fridge again and decided to share my thoughts.,
,
The color is orangey golden, cloudy. Somewhat see through but overall opaque. I believe this one's bottle conditioned. Pours a small head that dissipates after a minute or two but remains soapy on top. ,
Smells hoppy, malty. It's nice. It's got your typical hop aromas, but I'm not gonna dissect them today. It's good in this department.,
,
Despite what the smell might suggest, this is not a very hoppy ipa. It is very smooth however. The alcohol has a bit of presence- possibly a bit too much for newcomers. I find it might benefit from a 1% or so reduction, taste wise, but I wouldn't claim to be firm on this. According to my roommate, it's 'got good flavor, but is a little bit strong'.,
The feel is a bit chewy, perhaps a bit thick, but the carbonation is on point. Good.,
,
I'd think of this less as an India Pale Ale and more... just an ale. I like it, though. Would recommend if you're in the mood for a refreshing or smooth ale. If you're looking for grapefruit, pine, etc, grab a Sculpin, or a Sherman instead. Price point is about right. 8$-10$ for a sixer. I like this one as a change of pace, might make a good starter ipa for some as well.,
,
Note that I don't know how old these were when bought. I'd like to try this one fresh if I got a chance to see how much hop flavor is present fresh.,
Edit: did just that, much hoppier, solid ipa. This one ages well., ","Jan 24, 2016",4,3.5,4,,4.25,4.25,Deerin

,
Appearance – The beer is served a golden orange color with a one finger head of white foam.  The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good lot of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.,
,
Smell –The aroma of the brew is strongest of a citrus hop smell of grapefruit and a bit of tangerine.  Along with these smells comes some lighter hop smells of pine and a little bit of bread.,
,
Taste-The taste begins with more crackery, but lightly doughy taste that has a decent sum of grapefruit hop and some lighter tangerine fruitiness upfront.  As the taste advances the citrus grows slightly stronger all while the doughy fades away.  Toward the end the pine and some earth start hitting the tongue balancing out the citrus and cracker nicely.  With a little bit of grass one is left with a crisp and nicely hopped taste to linter on the tongue.,
,
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is rather high.  For the crisp flavors and danker hop the feel is awesome and makes for an easy sipping and hoppy brew.,
,
Overall – This was a rather tasty brew overall.  Rather crisp and nicely hop blended with a still easy drinking feel and taste.  Quite crisp and nice., ","Oct 31, 2016",3.75,3.75,3.75,-7.1%,3.5,3.75,Darkmagus82

4.86,170128,"  rDev ,Joe has a medium amber look and a fresh, hoppy smell that immediately gives away its simcoe hop ingredient. The taste is outstanding - a finely balanced hop trio with the simcoe standing out above the other two. The feel on the palate is light and smooth with a great triangular hoppy bitter bite and a lingering aftertaste. Again the simcoe stands out. My overall impression of this beer, after tasting hundreds of IPAs is that it is one of the best tasting, best balanced, most satisfying India Pale Ales on the market today. It has become my go-to IPA., ","Oct 07, 2016",4.75,4,5,,4.75,5,blainesnowman

,
Look - Color is a clear gold with a thick white head. Good head retention and tons of lacing. It is has a west-coast look foreshadowing a lighter grain bill which I prefer. ,
Smell - is good but underwhelming compared to some of the top notch IPA's, could be stronger. ,
Taste - is awesome (and would be better with stronger supporting aroma). Spicy, piney and citrus bitterness explodes on the palate only slightly balanced by a light malt backbone. I get some major grapefruit!,
Feel- Finishes with a drying bitterness on the back of the tongue. light, crisp and dry. ,
Overall- A very good IPA and my first beer from 10 barrel. I know they are now the ""enemy"" after being acquired by AB-Inbev  but at the price point I wanted to give them a try. If I try and remove the bias of their new ownership -  then I come away with it being a truly a great IPA., ","Oct 29, 2015",4.25,4.5,4.25,,4,4.25,CO-Bloom

Medium-full bodied with plenty of bready, malty grapefruit and citrus flavors.  At times verging on the more tropical with notes of pineapple and papaya, but truly a second fiddle to the more orange citrus notes.  ,

Initial malty richness quickly gives way to a bitter fruitiness.  Very well balanced despite the relatively high ABV.  This is worth trying for sure.  Definitely a beer somm type of beer., ","Jul 14, 2015",4.25,4,4.25,,4.5,4,muldersha

Smells amazing. Has ""that smell"" I love in an IPA. I always describe it like candy and everyone always looks at me weird. A really colorful profile of hop aroma. 4 hop flavors isn't a crazy amount, but they work well together. There's piney, a little citrus, a little fruity. NICE! Can smell the malt! YAY!

In the aroma the Mosaic and Amarillo is present, even on the front end of the tongue you feel a bit of fruit but then the middle you get a piney/peppery hop bite of the Simcoe.

4.11,53808,"  rDev ,Appearance - Pours relatively clear and a light golden orange in color. The head peaks at a half finger thick and rolls back quickly to a thin, broken layer of surface suds. Virtually no lacing.,
,
Smell - Hoppy aroma as expected, with notes of pine, citrus and pineapple. Clean malt breadiness underneath. ,
,
Taste - A modestly hoppy IPA, but well tuned to create a simple harmonious buzz. Orange is at the forefront with backing notes of pineapple and a hint of grapefruit. Malts that hint at caramel, but moreso imparts a lightly toasted breadiness. Touches of mango and peach with it's stoney pit. Moderate pine and citrus pith bitterness come through near the finish, but orange sweetness is there too, delivering a balanced bittersweet aftertaste.,
,
Mouthfeel - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Slick and smooth on the tongue, exhibiting a stupid ability to drink before a semi-dry finish.,
,
Overall - Damn, this is good. It's not the most aggressively hop-forward IPA's I've had but I'll be damned if it's not one of the smoothest and more brilliantly woven ones I can recall.

It’s got very citrusy hops and a light malt and yeast that didn’t eat up all the sugar so it’s a little sweet for my liking but others might just call it well balanced. Compares favorably to old standbys like Sierra Nevada pale. It seems like they were trying to make an everyday-drinking, Joe Six Pack IPA for people who like citrusy west coast style IPAs and they succeeded. It’s a technically proficient and tasty brew, but nothing too special. Hides its alcohol OK. 4.25/5., ","Aug 22, 2015",4,4.25,4.25,,4.5,4.25,bsonk

4.24,170128,"  rDev ,Very solid NW IPA. Nice smell, good solid feel. Of the 3 hops used I felt Mosaic to be the most prominent. Malt back is very minimal, true to the west coast style.

I am laughing because JohnGalt1 says he thinks of Flintstone vitamins, and he is exactly right. Tangerine peel and-- remember Fizzies? Orange flavor. This is too weird. But a decent quaff.

3.99,170128,"  rDev ,in this particular case, i dont care about who owns who and all of that, its nice to see this beer in the colorado market, and im judging the beer on its liquid not its politics, and its darn good ipa. super light in color, looks like a wheat beer more than an american ipa, and there may in fact be some wheat in here. the nose is tropical hops all the way, amarillo and mosiac sounds about right, their profiles are distinct, and their union here is fabulous. i think the beer smells a little better than it tastes, not quite so dynamic and floral and succulent on the taste, but you still get those hops coming through, especially on the back end. because of how light the malt is, there really isnt much body here. the beer would feel almost watered down if it wasnt for the lively carbonation that keeps it moving so swiftly. i think the abv is spot on for the style, and i was impressed that this was as different as it was. very well done and tasty brew, should compete strongly here in colorado., ","May 24, 2015",4,3.75,4,,4,4,StonedTrippin

4.08,170128,"  rDev ,Bright golden honey peach tone orangey color with minimal but lacy foam. Peach on the nose as well hay honeysuckle apple, it's very tart tasting that balances out the hops and complements the mouthfeel is a pleasantly puckersome way. It certainly makes an impact on first sip and has bright Amarillo and fruity Mosaic and the solid Simcoe and it works. It's delicious! Lucky me for buying the 12 variety pack, which also had Apocalypse, Easy Black IPA, and s1nist0r Black Ale, as my introduction to this brewery. Since getting to Oregon, I seem to be buying mostly Bend breweries. Got to go visit there.,
edit: having another one two days later, a sip from the bottle yields a massive grapefruit flavor, but it's blended in with the malt after pouring into a glass and it's more of a rounded flavor, just in case anyone is going through their reactionary anti-grapefruit phase., ","May 02, 2015",3.75,4.25,4.25,,3.75,4.25,trentbent

4.3,170128,"  rDev ,This brew came in a very affordable $14 mixed 12 pack of 10 Barrel.,
,
In contrast to most ""pale"" IPAs, this brew actually is pale golden in color, with slight haziness and a nice head that leaves behind some lace.,
,
I noticed a strong whiff of grapefruit-mandarin-citrus-hops as I poured it, some of my favorite aromas from a beer.  Definitely on the tropical/nectar side of the hop aromas, and it's hard to detect any malts.  Not only great aromas but great intensity help boost the score for me.,
,
Flavor is hop-forward but not much bitterness, with light and mellow maltiness.  Medium carbonation plays well with the happiness, and this beer has a pretty long, slick finish.,
,
Overall, another fantastic IPA from 10 Barrel.  I wasn't impressed with their winter warmer, but their IPAs stand out among the crowded grocery aisle as some of the best easily-found IPAs here in Oregon., ","May 01, 2015",4.25,4,4.25,,4.5,4.25,josiahschlender

Single 12oz purchased at the COOP... Pours a mostly clear golden with a long-lasting off white head that leaves behind great lacing. Bunches of tropical fruity hoppiness with a tangerine backbone on the nose.. Flavor is not nearly as hoppy as expected, a fruity/mineral note reminds me immediately of the Flintstone vitamins my Mom made me take when I was a kid.. Hop flavors are mainly on the finish .. Not nearly as bitter as most PNW IPA's... Surprisingly drinkable.,
